00:00, ARIZONA IS THE GRAND CANYON
00:00,STATE.
00:00,BEAUTIFUL LOOK AT GRAND CANYON
00:00,NATIONAL PARK.
00:02,COUPLE OF HOURS' DRIVE NORTH OF
00:04,THE GREATER PHOENIX AREA.
00:06,JUST A SPECTACULAR SUNDAY
00:08,AFTERNOON.
00:09,AND NOW A LOOK AT THE UNIVERSITY
00:11,"OF PHOENIX STADIUM, WHICH OPENED"
00:12,IN 2006 AND IS THE HOME OF THE
00:14,ARIZONA CARDINALS.
00:15,BILL BELICHICK WEARING HIS
00:17,FAVORITE HOODIE.
00:19,THAT NO. 2 PENCIL WILL GO
00:20,INTO HIS EAR SHORTLY.
00:22,STEVEN HAUSCHKA WILL BE KICKING
00:23,OFF FOR THE SEATTLE SEAHAWKS.
00:26,AND NEW ENGLAND WILL START ON
00:28,"OFFENSE, AS BACK TO RECEIVE THE"
00:30,KICK IS DANNY AMENDOLA.
00:35,THE GAME IS A TOSS-UP.
00:37,BOTH TEAMS ARE TERRIFIC.
00:38,PETE CARROLL ALWAYS ENJOYING THE
00:41,MOMENT.
00:41,"MARSHAWN LYNCH, WHAT KIND OF A"
00:43,DAY WILL HE HAVE?
00:43,BUT HE'S GONNA START WITH
00:45,SKITTLES.
00:47,SO NOTHING ELSE IS NEW.
00:49, [ CHUCKLES ]
00:50, MIGHT AS WELL JUST BE A
00:52,PRESEASON GAME IN AUGUST FOR
00:54,HIM.
00:54,RICHARD SHERMAN READY TO GO TO
00:56,WORK.
00:57,INJURED HIS ELBOW.
00:58,"EARL THOMAS, THE DISLOCATED"
00:59,"SHOULDER, BUT BOTH WILL PLAY"
01:01,"TODAY, AS HAUSCHKA GETS READY TO"
01:03,KICK OFF.
01:07,SUPER BOWL XLIX UNDER WAY IN
01:10,"GLENDALE, ARIZONA."
01:12,WE'LL START WITH A RUNBACK BY
01:13,AMENDOLA FROM 5 YARDS DEEP.
01:16,AND TO THE 18-YARD LINE HE
01:18,"COMES, AND THAT'S WHERE"
01:19,NEW ENGLAND WILL SET UP SHOP.
01:24,TOM BRADY.
01:25,"HE SAID TO US YESTERDAY, AFTER"
01:27,WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON OVER THE
01:28,"LAST TWO WEEKS, HE SAID, ""THERE"
01:30,WOULD NOT BE A GAME I WOULD WANT
01:32,"TO WIN MORE THAN THIS ONE."""
01:35, NO SHORTAGE OF RED MEAT IN
01:37,"FRONT OF TOM BRADY FOR THIS ONE,"
01:39,IS THERE?
01:41, HE HAS SHANE VEREEN AS HIS
01:44,RUNNING BACK.
01:46,"MEANWHILE, NOW YOU'VE GOT"
01:48,GRONKOWSKI FLANKED WAY OUT TO
01:51,"THE RIGHT, NEAR THE SIDELINE."
01:55,SHERMAN ON HIM.
01:56,BRADY STARTS FROM THE SHOTGUN.
01:59,THAT'S EDELMAN IN SHORT MOTION.
02:02,AND THE FIRST PLAY IS A PASS TO
02:04,THE OUTSIDE.
02:05,"IT'S CAUGHT NEAR THE SIDELINE,"
02:07,BUT ONLY A MINIMAL GAIN NOW FOR
02:09,GRONKOWSKI.
02:09,BRUCE IRVIN MAKING THE TACKLE.
02:12,SECOND AND LONG.
02:14,"BRADY, SIXTH SUPER BOWL START."
02:17,HE'S THROWN 197 PASSES IN THOSE
02:19,GAMES.
02:20,"1,277 THROUGH THE AIR."
02:22,ALL SUPER BOWL RECORDS.
02:23,"THREE WINS, TWO LOSSES."
02:27,AND ONE OF THOSE LOSSES CAME
02:29,"HERE AFTER THE '07 SEASON, TO"
02:31,"SPOIL THE PERFECT SEASON, AS THE"
02:33,NEW YORK GIANTS DID THEM IN.
02:35,LeGARRETTE BLOUNT IS NOW IN THE
02:37,BACKFIELD.
02:38,SECOND DOWN AND 8.
02:42,THIS IS AMENDOLA COMING IN
02:43,MOTION.
02:44,SHORT DROP.
02:45,PASS CAUGHT ON THE OUTSIDE.
02:47,BREAKING A TACKLE AND COMING UP
02:49,ABOUT 2 YARDS SHY OF THE FIRST
02:50,"DOWN IS AMENDOLA, AS HE GETS"
02:52,AWAY FROM RICHARD SHERMAN.
02:54,AND THAT WILL SET UP A THIRD
02:56,DOWN AND 2 FOR THE PATRIOTS.
03:01," WELL, CLEARLY ONE OF THE"
03:02,THINGS WE TALKED ABOUT RIGHT OFF
03:04,"THE BAT IS, HOW CAN YOU HANDLE"
03:05,THESE PASS RUSHERS?
03:06,THAT'S ONE WAY.
03:07,GET THEM ON THE GROUND WITH SOME
03:09,QUICK THROWS.
03:10,AND THEN IT'S RICHARD SHERMAN ON
03:11,THE OUTSIDE.
03:12,WE HAVE TO KEEP AN EYE ON THAT
03:13,ELBOW.
03:14,WILL HE BE ABLE TO TACKLE?
03:15,WILL HE BE ABLE TO JAM THE
03:16,RECEIVERS THE WAY THAT HE
03:18,TYPICALLY CAN?
03:19," IN THAT GREEN BAY GAME, IT"
03:20,LOOKED LIKE HE WAS PLAYING WITH
03:22,AN INVISIBLE SLING.
03:25,THIRD AND 2.
03:27,BRADY.
03:27,"GOOD, CLEAN POCKET THROWS."
03:29,AND THAT'LL BE THE GAME'S FIRST
03:30,"FIRST DOWN, AS VEREEN --"
03:32,"SHANE VEREEN MAKES THE CATCH,"
03:33,AND HE'S TACKLED THERE BY THE
03:35,"OUTSIDE LINEBACKER, K.J. WRIGHT."
03:37, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S VERY
03:39,DIFFICULT WHEN YOU PLAY AGAINST
03:40,THE PATRIOTS -- IF YOU CLEAR
03:42,"ZONES, YOU HAVE TO HANDLE THE"
03:44,LIKES OF JULIAN EDELMAN AND
03:46,SHANE VEREEN WITH INSIDE
03:48,LINEBACKERS.
03:49,THEIR QUICKNESS VERY TOUGH TO
03:51,DEAL WITH.
03:51, NEW ENGLAND CAN BEAT YOU
03:53,EITHER WAY.
03:53,IN THE DIVISIONAL GAME AGAINST
03:55,"BALTIMORE, 53 PASSES, AND THEN"
03:56,40 RUNS AGAINST INDIANAPOLIS.
04:00,THIS IS BLOUNT.
04:03,THE SEAHAWKS EXPECT THEM TO BE
04:06,MORE BALANCED -- THE PATRIOTS --
04:07,TODAY.
04:08,SO HERE IS BLOUNT.
04:09,HE WAS A PATRIOT LAST YEAR.
04:10,HE SCORED FOUR TOUCHDOWNS IN A
04:12,PLAYOFF GAME AGAINST
04:13,INDIANAPOLIS.
04:13,THEN HE SIGNS WITH PITTSBURGH.
04:15,DOESN'T LIKE HIS ROLE THERE
04:16,BECAUSE Le'VEON BELL WAS CLEARLY
04:18,THE NUMBER-ONE BACK.
04:19,WALKS OFF THE FIELD BEFORE THE
04:21,"END OF A GAME IN NOVEMBER,"
04:22,"AND THEN WINDS UP SIGNING, AFTER"
04:25,"HE CLEARED WAIVERS, WITH"
04:27,NEW ENGLAND.
04:28,"SO HE RETURNS HOME, AND HE IS"
04:30,THEIR STUD RIGHT NOW BECAUSE
04:32,"JONAS GRAY, THEIR OTHER RUNNING"
04:34,"BACK, IS INACTIVE TONIGHT."
04:36,SECOND DOWN AND 8.
04:39,AND HERE'S BLOUNT.
04:42,AND BLOUNT GETS IT UP TO THE
04:43,35-YARD LINE.
04:44,WRIGHT MAKES THE DEFENSE.
04:47,THE SEATTLE DEFENSE BECOMING
04:50,LEGENDARY RIGHT NOW.
04:51,THEIR RANKS THIS YEAR -- FEWEST
04:53,"POINTS ALLOWED, FEWEST YARDS"
04:55,"ALLOWED, THIRD AGAINST THE RUSH,"
04:57,TOPS AGAINST THE PASS.
04:59,AND THEY'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR
05:00,THE LAST THREE SEASONS.
05:05,THIRD AND 6.
05:06,"DAN QUINN, THE DEFENSIVE"
05:07,"COORDINATOR, WHO IN THE NEXT 36"
05:09,HOURS OR SO WILL BE ANNOUNCED AS
05:11,THE HEAD COACH OF THE
05:13,ATLANTA FALCONS.
05:14,BUT FIRST THINGS FIRST FOR HIM
05:16,"HERE, AS NEW ENGLAND COMES UP"
05:17,SPREAD OUT.
05:20,FIVE RECEIVERS.
05:22,PLAY CLOCK IS DOWN TO :02.
05:24,THIRD AND 6.
05:25,BRADY ABLE TO SURVEY.
05:27,THROWS LOW AND INCOMPLETE.
05:28,"SO THEY GOT ONE FIRST DOWN, AND"
05:30,NOW THEY'LL HAVE TO PUNT.
05:32,BYRON MAXWELL COVERING VEREEN.
05:34,AND SEATTLE WILL GET THE BALL.
05:37, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S SO
05:38,IMPORTANT FOR THE PATRIOTS IN
05:40,THIS GAME IS TO FORCE THESE
05:42,DEFENSIVE ENDS TO RUN THE LOOP.
05:44,GO ALL THE WAY AROUND TOM BRADY
05:47,AND THEN TRY AND SECURE IT UP
05:49,FRONT TO MAKE SURE THAT
05:51,TOM BRADY CAN STEP UP.
05:52,"THAT TIME, A LITTLE ANTSY IN THE"
05:54,POCKET.
05:54,GOT RID OF IT QUICKLY.
05:56,MISSED THE THROW.
05:59, RYAN ALLEN.
06:01,THE LEFT-FOOTED PUNTER.
06:04,"GOOD, HIGH, DEEP PUNT."
06:05,FLAG IS DOWN AS IT'S TAKEN AT
06:07,THE 15-YARD LINE.
06:08,JERON JOHNSON CAME IN AND MAY
06:10,HAVE RUN INTO THE KICKER.
06:12,"IF HE RAN INTO THE KICKER, IF"
06:14,"IT'S THE 5-YARD VARIETY, IT'S"
06:15,STILL NOT GOING TO BE A FIRST
06:17,DOWN.
06:17,BILL VINOVICH WILL MAKE THE
06:19,CALL.
06:19,"IF THAT'S A 5-YARD PENALTY, IT"
06:21,WOULD BE FOURTH DOWN AND 1.
06:22,ROUGHING THE KICKER IS A FIRST
06:24,DOWN.
06:26,BIG CALL HERE.
06:27, I THINK HE GOT HIS PLANT
06:29,FOOT.
06:29, RUNNING INTO THE KICKER.
06:31,"KICKING TEAM, NUMBER 23."
06:32,5-YARD PENALTY.
06:34,STILL FOURTH DOWN.
06:35," ALL RIGHT, SO THAT'S THE"
06:36,"GARDEN VARIETY, AS IT WERE,"
06:40,WHICH MEANS THAT THE LINE OF
06:42,SCRIMMAGE WILL NOW BE THE
06:43,40-YARD LINE.
06:44,AND ANOTHER LOOK HERE.
06:47," THE RULE IS, IF YOU HIT THE"
06:50,PLANT LEG -- THIS LEG -- THAT'S
06:53,SUPPOSED TO BE 15 YARDS.
06:55,I DON'T SEE RUNNING INTO THE
06:57,KICKER RIGHT THERE.
06:58, FIRST DOWN.
06:59,TIME-OUT.
07:04," WELL, JERON JOHNSON, HE CAN"
07:06,"SMILE RIGHT NOW, BUT HE GOT AWAY"
07:07,WITH ONE.
07:08,"HAD IT BEEN ROUGHING THE KICKER,"
07:10,IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A 15-YARD
07:11,PENALTY AND A FIRST DOWN.
07:12,"HERE IT IS AGAIN, CRIS."
07:13, SO THE NONKICKING LEG --
07:15,"WHEN YOU HIT THAT LEG, THAT'S 15"
07:17,YARDS AND AN AUTOMATIC FIRST
07:19,DOWN.
07:19,WITHOUT QUESTION.
07:22,"BILL VINOVICH'S CALL, AND HE"
07:23,MISSED IT.
07:24, SO IT WOULD HAVE BEEN FOURTH
07:26,AND 1.
07:26,NEW ENGLAND DECLINES THE
07:27,PENALTY.
07:28,THEY'LL TAKE THE PLAY.
07:29,THAT WAS A 49-YARD PUNT.
07:30,THE BALL IS AT THE 16-YARD LINE.
07:32,AND LYNCH CARRIES.
07:34,"""BEAST MODE"" UP TO THE 20-YARD"
07:36,LINE BEFORE HE'S TACKLED BY HALF
07:38,OF THE STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS.
07:40,RUSSELL WILSON.
07:41,WHEN HE FACES SUPER BOWL-WINNING
07:44,QUARTERBACKS -- HIS CAREER NOW
07:46,"THREE YEARS OLD -- HE'S 10-0,"
07:48,INCLUDING A WIN AGAINST
07:49,TOM BRADY WHEN THESE TWO TEAMS
07:52,"LAST MET IN SEATTLE, EARLY IN"
07:54,THE SEASON IN 2012.
07:55,"SEATTLE WON THE GAME, COMING"
07:57,"FROM BEHIND, AND WILSON SAID,"
07:59,"""THAT REALLY GOT US GOING."""
08:03,HE HAD A GOOD YEAR IN '12.
08:04,OF COURSE THEY WON THE
08:06,"SUPER BOWL LAST YEAR, AND THIS"
08:07,YEAR NFC CHAMPS AGAIN.
08:09,SECOND AND 7.
08:11,STACK THREE RECEIVERS TO THE
08:13,LEFT.
08:13,WILSON HAD TO REACH DOWN FOR THE
08:15,SNAP.
08:16,AND THAT'S MARSHAWN LYNCH
08:18,PICKING UP A COUPLE.
08:19,ABOUT 2 YARDS SHY OF THE FIRST.
08:21,THIRD DOWN AND SHORT.
08:23, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE
08:25,SEEN IS SOMETIMES WHEN
08:26,"MAX UNGER, THE CENTER, IS MOVING"
08:28,"TO HIS LEFT, THE SNAPS GO TO THE"
08:30,RIGHT.
08:31,THEY HAD AN ISSUE WITH THAT IN
08:32,"THE CHAMPIONSHIP GAME, AND HERE"
08:34,WE GO WITH THE EARLY SNAP WITH
08:36,THE SAME ISSUE.
08:38, THAT'S OF PARTICULAR
08:39,IMPORT -- THEY'RE TRYING TO RUN
08:41,THE READ OPTION.
08:42,CAN THROW ALL THE TIMING OFF.
08:43, NO DOUBT.
08:44, THIRD AND 2.
08:49,THEY GO FOUR WIDE HERE.
08:53,AND LYNCH IS GOING TO GET
08:54,STACKED UP AND STOPPED.
08:58,SO AFTER SEATTLE GETS THAT BREAK
09:00,AND GETS THE BALL AFTER WHAT
09:01,"SHOULD HAVE BEEN ROUGHING,"
09:03,IT'S A THREE-AND-OUT AND THEY'LL
09:04,GET THE BALL BACK.
09:05, BIG VINCE WILFORK RIGHT
09:07,HERE.
09:08,YOU NEED YOUR SUPERSTARS TO
09:09,PLAY HUGE IN THE SUPER BOWL.
09:11,THERE YOU GO.
09:12,HE STANDS HIM UP.
09:13,IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S
09:14,BENCH-PRESSING JUSTIN BRITT OFF
09:16,OF HIM.
09:17,HE MAKES CONTACT -- THOSE HUGE
09:19,"ARMS, HE EXTENDS THEM OUT,"
09:21,"GAINS CONTROL, AND MAKES A BIG"
09:23,PLAY.
09:23, JON RYAN TO PUNT.
09:24,IT WAS RYAN WHO WAS HOLDING ON A
09:26,FAKE FIELD GOAL THAT TURNED INTO
09:28,A TOUCHDOWN WHEN THEY WERE DOWN
09:30,16-0 TO GREEN BAY.
09:31,THAT WAS A HUMONGOUS PLAY IN
09:33,THAT GAME.
09:36,NOSE DOWN WITH A LOT OF
09:38,BACKSPIN.
09:39,FAIRLY SHORT KICK.
09:40,FAIR CATCH CALLED FOR AND MADE
09:42,BY EDELMAN.
09:43,"BILL BELICHICK, NO. 2 PENCIL"
09:46,AT THE READY.
09:48,AT LEAST HE'S NOT WEARING THE
09:49,FLIP-FLOPS THAT HE WORE ALL WEEK
09:51,LONG.
09:51,HE'S GOT HIS SNEAKERS ON TODAY.
09:53, [ LAUGHS ]
09:53,FORMAL WEAR.
09:55, QUITE A SCENE AT MEDIA DAY.
09:58,BRADY TO WORK.
09:59,STARTS FROM THE GUN.
10:01,FROM THE 32.
10:03,PRESSURE PUT ON.
10:04,"VEREEN, WITH SOME HELP OUT IN"
10:06,FRONT.
10:07,TAKES IT OUT TO THE 35-YARD
10:09,LINE.
10:09,THAT'S A SHORT GAIN.
10:11,"KEEP AN EYE, CRIS, OBVIOUSLY ON"
10:13,"KAM CHANCELLOR, WHO GOT BANGED"
10:14,UP IN PRACTICE THE OTHER DAY.
10:16,HURT HIS KNEE AND WEARING A
10:17,BRACE.
10:18, AND HE'S NOT A SPEED PLAYER
10:20,ANYWAY.
10:20,"HE'S ESSENTIALLY, AS"
10:21,"BILL BELICHICK CALLS HIM, A"
10:23,"LINEBACKER, HE'S SO CLOSE TO THE"
10:24,LINE OF SCRIMMAGE.
10:25,BUT HE IS THE HAMMER ON THE BACK
10:27,"END, THE GUY THAT DELIVERS THOSE"
10:29,BIG HITS.
10:30,"AND YOU JUST HAVE TO WONDER NOW,"
10:32,IF HE DOES GET IN MAN-COVERAGE
10:34,"SITUATIONS, WILL HE BE THE SAME?"
10:37, CHANCELLOR PLAYS DOWN LOW.
10:38,EARL THOMAS PLAYS DEEP.
10:40,THEY'VE GOT DEVELIN IN AT
10:42,FULLBACK.
10:42,"THE FAKE TO BLOUNT, AND BRADY"
10:44,FLIPS IT TO THE SIDE FOR A
10:45,FIRST DOWN.
10:46,JULIAN EDELMAN TAKEN OUT THERE
10:49,BY BYRON MAXWELL.
10:50, AND THIS IS EXACTLY THE KIND
10:52,OF GAME THAT THE
10:53,NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS AND
10:54,TOM BRADY WANTS TO PLAY HERE.
10:56,YOU HAVE TO GET THE BALL OUT OF
10:58,YOUR HANDS QUICKLY WHENEVER YOU
11:00,PLAY AGAINST SEATTLE.
11:02,"AS A MATTER OF FACT, SEATTLE IN"
11:03,"PRACTICE THIS WEEK, AT 2.3"
11:05,"SECONDS, THE COACHES BLEW THE"
11:07,WHISTLE.
11:07,"THEY SAID, ""YOU WILL NOT HAVE"
11:09,ANY MORE TIME THAN THAT TO GET
11:10,"TO TOM BRADY."""
11:17, 8:12 LEFT IN THE OPENING
11:18,QUARTER.
11:21,PATRIOTS LINE UP
11:22,CAMERON FLEMING AT TACKLE AS
11:24,ELIGIBLE.
11:25,THEY DID THAT 28 TIMES IN THE
11:27,AFC CHAMPIONSHIP GAME.
11:28,AND A NICE LITTLE HOLE HERE
11:29,"EXPLOITED BY BLOUNT, TAKING IT"
11:31,ACROSS THE 50 TO THE 49-YARD
11:33,LINE.
11:33,AND THAT WILL MAKE IT SECOND
11:35,DOWN AND 5 FOR THE PATS.
11:37," RYAN WENDELL, ONE OF THEIR"
11:39,"BEST RUN BLOCKERS, IS GONNA LEAD"
11:41,THE WAY ON THE POWER PLAY HERE.
11:43,AND THIS IS WHAT THE PATRIOTS
11:45,ARE HOPING TO DO.
11:46,THE BUZZ WORD FOR THEM THIS WEEK
11:48,"WAS ""CONTROL."""
11:49,"""WE HAVE TO CONTROL THE GAME."""
11:51,"THEY'RE HOPING FOR 30, 35 RUNS"
11:53,IN THIS GAME WITH
11:54,LeGARRETTE BLOUNT.
11:56, AND BLOUNT IN AGAIN.
11:58,NOW YOU'VE GOT DEVELIN AS THE
12:00,FULLBACK.
12:01,HE SCORED A TOUCHDOWN
12:03,IN THE CHAMPIONSHIP GAME.
12:05,BLOUNT SAYS SOMETHING TO DEVELIN
12:07,"AT THE END, AS THE SNAP -- FROM"
12:09,BRADY TO BLOUNT.
12:11,AND HE GETS GANG-TACKLED AS HE
12:13,REACHES THE 48-YARD LINE.
12:15,IT'LL BE THIRD DOWN AND 3.
12:17,TONY McDANIEL RIGHT IN THE
12:18,MIDDLE FOR THE TACKLE.
12:21,JOSH McDANIELS IS THE OFFENSIVE
12:22,COORDINATOR.
12:23,HE HAD BEEN IN NEW ENGLAND.
12:24,"REMEMBER, WENT TO DENVER, THAT"
12:26,DIDN'T WORK OUT.
12:27,WENT TO ST. LOUIS FOR A LITTLE
12:28,WHILE.
12:29,NOW BACK AS THE OFFENSIVE
12:30,COORDINATOR.
12:31,WE THOUGHT HE WOULD BE MUCH IN
12:33,DEMAND WITH THE COACHING
12:34,"VACANCIES, AND HE WAS, BUT HE"
12:35,HAS CHOSEN TO STAY IN
12:37,"NEW ENGLAND, AT LEAST FOR"
12:38,ANOTHER YEAR.
12:41,THIRD AND 3.
12:45,"BRADY, A QUICK TOSS."
12:47,INSIDE SLANT.
12:48,CAN GRONKOWSKI GET THE FIRST
12:50,DOWN?
12:51,HE CAN.
12:52,CHANCELLOR IS THERE TO MAKE THE
12:53,TACKLE.
12:54,"NEEDED 3, GOT 4."
12:55,"FIRST DOWN, NEW ENGLAND."
12:58, JULIAN EDELMAN ON THE
12:59,"INSIDE, JUST GONNA RUN OUT HERE."
13:01,AND THERE IS A COLLISION AND A
13:04,FIRST DOWN.
13:05,TOM BRADY NEVER EVEN GOT A
13:07,CHANCE TO FIND THE LACES ON THAT
13:08,ONE.
13:08,HE DIDN'T CARE.
13:09,"HE FOUND THE BIG GUY, NUMBER 87."
13:13,ONE OF THE THINGS WE KNEW WAS
13:14,GOING TO HAPPEN IS THAT THEY
13:16,WERE GOING TO CHALLENGE
13:17,NATE SOLDER WITH THAT SPIN MOVE
13:19,INSIDE.
13:19,"TWO YEARS AGO, 2012, THEY"
13:23,"PLAYED, CHRIS CLEMONS HAD A"
13:24,LOT OF SUCCESS AGAINST
13:25,NATE SOLDER WITH THAT MOVE.
13:27, EDELMAN IN MOTION TO THE
13:29,OUTSIDE.
13:35,"BRADY IDENTIFYING THE ""MIKE,"" OR"
13:36,MIDDLE LINEBACKER.
13:39,BRADY FLIPS IT AGAIN TO THE
13:40,OUTSIDE.
13:41,VEREEN.
13:43,SHANE VEREEN TO THE 40.
13:44,"BOY, IT'S BEEN A MERRY-GO-ROUND"
13:45,AT RUNNING BACK FOR THE PATRIOTS
13:47,THIS YEAR.
13:47,THEY STARTED WITH STEVAN RIDLEY.
13:49,HE GOT HURT.
13:50,THEN VEREEN.
13:50,THEN JONAS GRAY CAME ON AND WAS
13:52,SPECTACULAR FOR A WHILE.
13:53,"MISSED A MEETING, AND THEN THEY"
13:55,BENCHED HIM AND PUT IN BLOUNT.
13:58, THERE GOES VEREEN OUT.
13:59,BUT WATCH AFTER HE CATCHES THIS
14:01,"BALL, HOW EVERYBODY COMES"
14:02,DOWN -- THREE GUYS RIGHT THERE
14:04,TO MAKE THE TACKLE.
14:06,ONE OF THE BIG POINTS OF
14:08,EMPHASIS IN THIS GAME IS NO
14:09,YARDS AFTER THE CATCH.
14:11,IF THEY CAN TACKLE LIKE THAT ALL
14:13,"DAY, THEY'LL BE FINE HERE."
14:14, GRONKOWSKI SETS UP ON THE
14:16,RIGHT SIDE FOR LEVERAGE.
14:17,"AND BLOUNT FIGHTING HIS WAY,"
14:19,TRYING TO PICK UP THOSE EXTRA
14:21,2 YARDS TO GET THE FIRST.
14:22,"HE'S ABOUT A HALF YARD SHY, AS"
14:24,HE TAKES IT INSIDE THE 35-YARD
14:26,LINE.
14:27,IT WILL BE THIRD AND 1.
14:29, THAT WAS THE QUESTION IN
14:31,THIS GAME -- WHICH OF THESE BIG
14:33,BACKS COULD CONTROL THE GAME?
14:34,"MARSHAWN LYNCH,"
14:36,LeGARRETTE BLOUNT?
14:37,"THE PATRIOTS SAY, ""WE'RE A"
14:38,LONG-DRIVE TEAM.
14:39,WE'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO STRING
14:41,"THESE TOGETHER LIKE THIS."""
14:42,"AND SO FAR IN THIS ONE, THEY"
14:43,ARE.
14:44, OFTTIMES BRADY LIKES TO
14:46,"SNEAK, BUT NORMALLY IT'S WHEN"
14:48,THEY GET TO THE LINE EARLIER
14:50,THAN THIS.
14:52,THIRD AND 1.
14:54,HANDS IT TO BLOUNT.
14:55,SWINGS TO THE OUTSIDE.
14:56,TURNS THE CORNER.
14:57,PICKS UP THE FIRST DOWN.
14:59,LeGARRETTE BLOUNT TAKES IT TO
15:00,THE 25-YARD LINE.
15:01,EARL THOMAS WITH THAT DISLOCATED
15:03,SHOULDER -- HE TOLD US HE
15:04,COULDN'T HAVE PLAYED IF THIS
15:06,GAME HAD BEEN LAST WEEK -- MAKES
15:07,THE STOP.
15:08, BOUNCE OUT ALL THE WAY.
15:09,THEY'RE GOING TO COME WITH THE
15:11,"FULLBACK, DEVELIN, HERE, WHO'S"
15:12,GONNA GET THAT OUTSIDE EDGE.
15:14,"IT LOOKED LIKE AN INSIDE RUN,"
15:15,BUT THE WHOLE WAY THAT WAS
15:17,INTENDED TO GO OUT ON THE EDGE.
15:18,"AND THERE WAS BYRON MAXWELL,"
15:20,"JUMPED INSIDE, AND PICKED UP A"
15:21,BIG FIRST DOWN.
15:26," PATRIOTS, FOUR FIRST DOWNS"
15:27,IN THE GAME.
15:28,"SEATTLE, NONE."
15:29,THEY HAD A THREE-AND-OUT.
15:31,SIMPLE PLAY THROUGH THE MIDDLE.
15:32,NOT MUCH THERE.
15:34,TAKING IT TO THE 24-YARD LINE
15:36,THROUGH THE MIDDLE IS BLOUNT.
15:40,"IN POSTSEASON PLAY, THE SEATTLE"
15:42,"DEFENSE, WHICH IS SPECTACULAR,"
15:44,"BUT IN THE REGULAR SEASON, AS"
15:46,"YOU CAN SEE, THIRD IN THE"
15:48,"LEAGUE, BUT IN THE TWO"
15:49,"POSTSEASON GAMES, AND THOSE"
15:51,WOULD BE THE GAMES AGAINST
15:53,"CAROLINA AND AGAINST GREEN BAY,"
15:55,AND EDDIE LACY HAD A BIG FIRST
15:57,THREE QUARTERS -- 133 1/2.
15:59,SECOND DOWN AND 8.
16:03,FROM THE 24.
16:08,THE FAKE TO BLOUNT.
16:09,THE PASS TO AMENDOLA.
16:11,AND HE HAS A FIRST DOWN.
16:14,DANNY AMENDOLA MAKES HIS SECOND
16:17,CATCH.
16:19, SO FAR THEY'RE COMPLETELY
16:21,NEUTRALIZING THE RUSH OF
16:22,SEATTLE.
16:23,HERE WE GO.
16:24,JUST RIGHT OUT IN THE FLAT.
16:26,LOOKED LIKE BRADY GAVE A LITTLE
16:28,LOOK INSIDE.
16:28,JEREMY LANE BIT ON THAT.
16:31,"AND SO FAR, THIS DRIVE COULD NOT"
16:33,BE GOING ANY BETTER FOR
16:34,"JOSH McDANIELS, THE OFFENSIVE"
16:36,COORDINATOR.
16:36,EXACTLY WHAT HE HOPED FOR -- BE
16:38,"ABLE TO POUND IT, QUICK PASSES."
16:41, BRADY HAS MISSED ONLY ONE
16:43,PASS -- 8 OF HIS FIRST 9.
16:46,THE BALL IS AT THE 14.
16:48,TOM AGAIN PROTECTED WELL.
16:49,"THROWS TO THE OUTSIDE, TO THE"
16:51,10-YARD LINE.
16:52,THAT WILL BE ABOUT A 4-YARD
16:54,GAIN AS HOOMANAWANUI MAKES THE
16:57,CATCH.
16:58,"IN THE RED ZONE, THE"
16:59,"NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS, THEY'VE"
17:01,BEEN INSIDE THE 20-YARD LINE ON
17:03,"10 OCCASIONS, HAVE SCORED 9"
17:04,TOUCHDOWNS.
17:05,"AND YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT BRADY,"
17:07,"CRIS -- LOOK, MOST QUARTERBACKS,"
17:08,"OBVIOUSLY, WOULD BE BETTER IN A"
17:10,"CLEAN POCKET, BUT TOM, THE"
17:12,DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HIM IN A
17:13,CLEAN POCKET AND GETTING
17:14,CONTACTED IS ENORMOUS.
17:16," YEAH, IT'S EASY TO HAVE A"
17:17,CLEAN POCKET WHEN YOU'RE
17:18,THROWING IT AFTER ABOUT A SECOND
17:20,AND A HALF.
17:21, RIGHT.
17:22,PART OF THE GAME PLAN.
17:23,SECOND AND 6.
17:26,AND STUFFED IN THE BACKFIELD.
17:28,LeGARRETTE BLOUNT.
17:29,"THAT'S MICHAEL BENNETT,"
17:30,"NUMBER 72, A GUY WHO, IN WHAT IS"
17:32,PRETTY MUCH A STANDARD TYPE OF
17:34,DEFENSE THAT LETS THE GUYS JUST
17:36,"DO THEIR JOBS, HE'S THE ONE GUY"
17:38,WHO MOVES AROUND ON THE LINE.
17:39, RIGHT THERE.
17:41,WILL PLAY ALL FIVE DEFENSIVE
17:42,LINE POSITIONS.
17:43,AND IT'S HIS QUICKNESS THAT IS
17:45,THE BIGGEST CONCERN FOR
17:46,BILL BELICHICK AND THE
17:48,NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS.
17:49,HE IS A GUY THAT THEY ARE GOING
17:51,TO TRY AND DOUBLE-TEAM AND HIT
17:53,ON A SECONDARY SHOT FROM THE
17:55,CENTER OR SOMEBODY ELSE BECAUSE
17:57,HIS QUICKNESS CREATES REAL
17:58,PROBLEMS.
17:59, THEY'VE HAD THE BALL 7 1/2
18:01,MINUTES.
18:02,HALF THE QUARTER.
18:03,THIRD AND 6.
18:05,BRADY DANCING.
18:06,AND IT IS PICKED AT THE 5-YARD
18:09,LINE.
18:10,JEREMY LANE!
18:12,STILL ON THE RUN.
18:14,TRIPPED UP.
18:16,PETE CARROLL RIGHT THERE TO
18:18,SALUTE HIM.
18:19,SO THE DRIVE ENDS ON A THIRD AND
18:23,6 AS LANE PICKS IT OFF.
18:27,AND HE'S DOWN.
18:29,THEY'VE WRAPPED UP HIS LEFT ARM.
18:30,"THAT'S THE FIRST INTERCEPTION,"
18:32,"REGULAR SEASON OR POSTSEASON, IN"
18:34,"HIS THREE YEARS, BUT HE PAYS THE"
18:35,"PRICE, AS HE GETS CARTED BACK TO"
18:37,THE LOCKER ROOM.
18:42,BRADY UNDER SOME PRESSURE THAT
18:44,TIME.
18:45,"THAT WAS A 13-PLAY, 58-YARD"
18:46,DRIVE.
18:47,IT TOOK 7:41.
18:48,ENDS WITH A PICK.
18:54, HARD TO BELIEVE THAT
18:55,TOM BRADY JUST MADE THAT
18:56,MISTAKE.
18:57,"UNDER PRESSURE, YES, BUT REALLY"
19:00,JUST THREW THAT ONE UP.
19:01," NEW ENGLAND'S RUN 19 PLAYS,"
19:03,SEATTLE'S RUN 3.
19:07,ALL OF THEM RUNS BY LYNCH.
19:10,THIS TIME IT IS WILSON LOOKING
19:11,DOWNFIELD.
19:12,TAKES CARE OF NINKOVICH WITH A
19:14,GOOD FAKE.
19:14,AND THERE HE GOES.
19:16,SLIDING TO A STOP AT THE 21-YARD
19:17,LINE.
19:18,AND THAT'S WHERE RUSSELL WILSON
19:19,"CAN REALLY KILL YOU, NOT ONLY"
19:21,"WITH HIS ARM, BUT WITH HIS LEGS."
19:22,AND BACK WE GO TO THE
19:23,INTERCEPTION.
19:24, HERE COMES BENNETT.
19:25,SCHOFIELD'S GONNA GO DOWN
19:27,INSIDE.
19:27,WATCH HOW LONG BENNETT WAITS.
19:29,"WAIT, WAIT, WAIT."
19:30,HERE HE COMES.
19:31,AND NOW ATTACKS TOM BRADY.
19:33,"AS SOON AS BRADY SEES HIM, HE"
19:35,BASICALLY TRIED TO JUST LEAN
19:37,"BACK A LITTLE BIT, AND THREW IT"
19:39,RIGHT INTO THE ARMS OF
19:40,JEREMY LANE.
19:41,HUGE MISTAKE.
19:43, SECOND DOWN AND 3.
19:48,WILSON YET TO THROW A PASS.
19:50,HERE'S LYNCH.
19:52,AND LOOK AT LYNCH.
19:53,SO TYPICAL OF LYNCH.
19:55,TURNS HIS SHOULDERS.
19:56,THEY CALL HIM A SPLIT-LEGGED
19:58,RUNNER.
19:58,YOU SEE HOW HE'S BUILT.
20:00,POWERFUL.
20:01,KNOCKS OVER PEOPLE.
20:03,HAS HAD SOME OF THE GREATEST
20:04,RUNS WE'VE SEEN IN THE LAST FIVE
20:05,YEARS.
20:06,FIRST DOWN HERE.
20:07," YEAH, IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS,"
20:09,"NO ONE HAS MORE RUSHING YARDS,"
20:10,"100-YARD GAMES, OR RUSHING"
20:12,TOUCHDOWNS THAN THIS GUY.
20:13,"THEY CALL HIM BEAST MODE, AND"
20:15,YOU SEE WHY.
20:16,"THESE ARE LARGE HUMAN BEINGS,"
20:17,AND THEY SIMPLY CANNOT GET HIM
20:19,ON THE GROUND.
20:20,YOU SEE IT GAME AFTER GAME THAT
20:22,WE DO.
20:26, NOW WILSON.
20:29,WITH FIVE RECEIVERS.
20:32,JUST A THREE-MAN RUSH FROM
20:33,NEW ENGLAND.
20:34,AND A SPY ON WILSON.
20:36,HAS TIME.
20:37,CAN'T GET ANY PRESSURE ON HIM.
20:39,THERE HE GOES.
20:40,AGAIN.
20:41,"LOOKING FOR THE FIRST DOWN, BUT"
20:43,COMING UP TO MAKE THE TACKLE
20:45,IS DARRELLE REVIS.
20:46,AND THAT IS A VERY FAST FIRST
20:48,QUARTER THAT HAS JUST COME TO AN
20:50,END.
20:51,BACK TO GLENDALE.
20:52,"AL MICHAELS, CRIS COLLINSWORTH,"
20:54,MICHELE TAFOYA.
20:54,THERE ARE YOUR NUMBERS THROUGH
20:56,THE FIRST QUARTER.
20:57,"NEW ENGLAND HAD THAT LONG DRIVE,"
20:59,AND THAT WAS ENDED WHEN LANE
21:02,PICKED OFF THE PASS.
21:03,THAT'S THE ONE TURNOVER.
21:04,"YOU KNOW, WE TALKED TO"
21:06,PETE CARROLL YESTERDAY -- BEFORE
21:07,"WE TALK ABOUT THAT, LET'S GO TO"
21:09,MICHELE FOR AN INJURY UPDATE.
21:10, YOU MENTIONED JEREMY LANE.
21:12,"IT WAS A COSTLY INTERCEPTION,"
21:14,AL.
21:14,HE IS DOUBTFUL WITH A LEFT-WRIST
21:16,INJURY.
21:16,HE HAS GONE BACK FOR X-RAYS.
21:18,YOU SAW HIM CARTED BACK TO THE
21:19,LOCKER ROOM.
21:20,BUT THAT MAY BE THE ONLY PLAY HE
21:22,"MAKES TONIGHT, AL."
21:23," THANK YOU, MICHELE."
21:24,HIT BY JULIAN EDELMAN AT THE END
21:26,OF THE PLAY.
21:27,SECOND DOWN AND 12.
21:28,HERE'S LYNCH.
21:30,"YOU KNOW, CRIS, WE TALKED TO"
21:31,PETE CARROLL YESTERDAY.
21:32,"I SAID, ""YOU THINK THIS STARTS"
21:34,LIKE THE HAGLER-HEARNS FIGHT
21:35,WHERE THE GUYS COME OUT AND JUST
21:37,TRY TO KILL EACH OTHER AT THE
21:38,"OUTSET, OR IS THIS MORE LIKE"
21:40,"YOU'RE PARRYING, YOU'RE TRYING"
21:41,"TO FEEL YOUR WAY THROUGH?"""
21:43,THAT'S THE WAY IT'S STARTED.
21:44," YEAH, THESE TWO GREAT"
21:46,"COACHES, THEY WANT TO SEE WHAT"
21:48,THE OTHER ONE IS GOING TO DO.
21:49,AND WE'VE SEEN IT IN SUPER BOWLS
21:51,BEFORE.
21:52,SOMEHOW BILL BELICHICK HAS A WAY
21:53,OF PLAYING IT A LITTLE BIT CLOSE
21:55,TO THE VEST.
21:56,BUT THAT'S A HUGE MISS RIGHT
21:57,THERE.
21:58,WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING AGAINST A
21:59,"DEFENSE LIKE THAT, YOU CAN'T"
22:00,TURN IT OVER WHEN POINTS ARE
22:02,SITTING THERE FOR YOU.
22:05," THIRD AND 9, WITH FIVE"
22:07,RECEIVERS OUT THERE.
22:08,WILSON IS UNDER SOME PRESSURE.
22:11,BUT THERE HE IS ESCAPING AND
22:13,SURVEYING.
22:13,NOW HE'LL GO BACK THE OTHER WAY.
22:15,HE GETS A NICE BLOCK.
22:16,AND THE PASS IS INCOMPLETE.
22:19,"DOWNFIELD, INTENDED FOR"
22:21,BRYAN WALTERS.
22:22,SO NOBODY COULD GET OPEN.
22:23,PRESSURE WAS PUT ON.
22:24,FOURTH AND 9.
22:25," WELL, HERE'S THE KEY --"
22:27,THE PATRIOTS ARE GOING ALL
22:28,MAN-TO-MAN COVERAGE.
22:30,"LOOK, ACROSS THE BOARD."
22:31,THERE'S REVIS RIGHT THERE ON
22:32,DOUG BALDWIN.
22:33,THAT'S GOING TO BE HIS MATCH
22:34,THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THE
22:35,DAY.
22:35,THE RECEIVERS ARE SCRAMBLING
22:37,"AROUND, TRYING TO MAKE A PLAY."
22:38,THERE JUST WAS ABSOLUTELY NOBODY
22:40,OPEN ANYWHERE.
22:42,"AND FOR RUSSELL WILSON, HE"
22:43,REALLY NEEDS TO FIND A LITTLE
22:44,"RHYTHM THROWING THE BALL, BUT SO"
22:46,FAR THIS COVERAGE TOO MUCH.
22:47, 0 FOR 1 IS WILSON.
22:49,THE OTHER PLAY WAS A SACK.
22:50,REVIS GOT CREDIT FOR A SACK ON
22:51,THE PLAY THAT ENDED THE FIRST
22:53,QUARTER.
22:54,NOW THE KICK HERE BY JON RYAN.
22:57,JULIAN EDELMAN.
22:58,SHORT KICK.
22:59,FIELDS AT THE 34.
23:01,DOES A LITTLE DANCING TO THE
23:02,OUTSIDE.
23:03,"TACKLED, AFTER A RUNBACK OF 2,"
23:06,BY BROCK COYLE.
23:07,LATE AFTERNOON HERE AT THE
23:08,UNIVERSITY OF PHOENIX STADIUM.
23:10,DARRELL BEVELL GOING OVER THINGS
23:12,WITH RUSSELL WILSON.
23:13,AND BRADY STARTS THIS DRIVE FROM
23:15,THE 35-YARD LINE.
23:18,BLOUNT IS THE BACK.
23:20,"AN ERRANT SNAP, BUT HE COLLECTS"
23:21,"IT AND THEN HITS AMENDOLA, WHO'S"
23:23,NOW CAUGHT THREE.
23:24,AND THAT'S A FIRST DOWN BEFORE
23:26,EARL THOMAS RUNS HIM INTO THE
23:28,PATRIOT BENCH.
23:32," WELL, WE'VE SEEN"
23:33,MICHAEL BENNETT HAVE AN EARLY
23:34,IMPACT ON THIS GAME FROM
23:36,SEVERAL DIFFERENT PLACES.
23:37,DAN CONNOLLY UNABLE TO GET HIS
23:39,HANDS ON HIM.
23:40,"THEN IN THE RUN GAME,"
23:42,"RYAN WENDELL, WHO CAN'T BLOCK"
23:44,HIM.
23:44,"AND THEN THE STUNT, WHERE"
23:45,HE'S GOING TO COME ALL THE WAY
23:47,AROUND.
23:47,AND THIS PRESSURE LEADS TO THE
23:50,BIG INTERCEPTION.
23:53, THAT WAS A GAIN OF 17 ON THE
23:55,LAST PLAY.
23:55,"GOOD PLAY FAKE, GOOD PLAY"
23:57,"ACTION, BUT GOOD COVERAGE ON"
23:58,THE OTHER SIDE -- INCOMPLETE.
24:00,THAROLD SIMON MAKES A NICE PLAY.
24:02,"BRANDON LaFELL, THE INTENDED"
24:04,RECEIVER.
24:05,"AND SIMON IS IN FOR LANE, WHO IS"
24:07,"MOST LIKELY DONE FOR THE DAY,"
24:08,SO THERE IS YOUR NEW NICKEL.
24:10,"AND, BOY, THAT LEGION OF BOOM"
24:12,"RIGHT NOW -- LANE, WHO IS KIND"
24:13,"OF A SUPPORTING ACTOR, IS OUT."
24:15,YOU'VE GOT THE ELBOW FOR
24:16,SHERMAN.
24:17,YOU GOT CHANCELLOR'S KNEE.
24:19,AND YOU HAVE THOMAS' SHOULDER.
24:21, AND SIMON'S GOT A BRACE
24:23,THERE.
24:24,"IT'S THAT TIME OF YEAR, AL."
24:25,YOU JUST HAVE TO STRAP IT ON AND
24:27,GO PLAY.
24:32, VEREEN IS THE BACK IN THIS
24:35,SET.
24:35,THERE GOES EDELMAN OUT OF THE
24:37,SLOT.
24:37,"BRADY, QUICK FLIP OVER THE"
24:39,MIDDLE.
24:39,CAUGHT.
24:40,THAT'S BRANDON LaFELL.
24:41,HAD A NICE YEAR.
24:42,CAME OVER FROM CAROLINA.
24:45,"PLAYED FOUR YEARS THERE, WAS AN"
24:47,UNRESTRICTED FREE AGENT.
24:48,THAT WILL MAKE IT THIRD DOWN AND
24:50,3
24:50, HERE'S THE CHANGEUP RIGHT
24:51,HERE.
24:52,NOW YOU SEE WHAT'S CALLED A BULL
24:53,RUSH.
24:54,THEY SET HIM UP WITH THE SPIN
24:55,"MOVE INSIDE, NATE SOLDER."
24:56,THEY'VE BEEN OUTSIDE.
24:57,"AND THAT TIME, THEY TRY TO GO"
24:59,RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE.
25:00,"SO FAR, NATE SOLDER'S HOLDING UP"
25:02,WELL.
25:05," SOLDER, THE ONLY FIRST-ROUND"
25:07,DRAFT CHOICE STARTING FOR THE
25:09,PATRIOT OFFENSE.
25:12,THIRD AND 3.
25:18,BRADY OUT OF THE POCKET.
25:19,AND HE CONNECTS HERE.
25:20,THAT WILL BE A FIRST DOWN.
25:22,VEREEN TO THE OUTSIDE.
25:23,"AND BOBBY WAGNER SAID, ""UGH!"""
25:24,CLAPPING HIS HANDS.
25:25,"SHOULD HAVE STOPPED HIM,"
25:27,COULDN'T -- FIRST DOWN.
25:28," HERE'S WHAT'S HAPPENING, AL."
25:29,THEY ARE JUST BASICALLY -- YOU
25:31,"KNOW, IN BASKETBALL, YOU CLEAR A"
25:33,"ZONE, YOU LET A MICHAEL JORDAN"
25:34,OR SOMEBODY GO ONE-ON-ONE?
25:36,IT'S THE SAME SORT OF THING
25:37,THAT'S HAPPENING HERE.
25:38,"SHANE VEREEN, THEY'RE CLEARING"
25:40,"OUT A ZONE, LETTING HIM GET INTO"
25:41,A ZONE WITH ONE OF THOSE
25:43,"LINEBACKERS, AND JUST TRY AND"
25:44,"MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENTS, GET HIM"
25:46,THE BALL AND ALLOW HIM TO BREAK
25:47,A TACKLE AND PICK UP A FIRST
25:49,DOWN.
25:49, SURGICAL.
25:52,"SHERMAN ON THE OUTSIDE, LINED UP"
25:54,AT THE BOTTOM AGAINST LaFELL.
25:56,"BRADY, GOOD PLAY FAKE, GOOD"
25:58,TIME.
25:59,DEEPEST PASS OF THE DAY FOR HIM.
26:01,AND IT'S INCOMPLETE.
26:02,GRONKOWSKI WITH SOME CONTACT AT
26:05,"THE END OF THE PLAY, BUT THERE"
26:07,IS NO FLAG.
26:08,IT WILL BE SECOND DOWN AND 10.
26:09, THAT'S A GOOD SIGN FOR
26:11,SEAHAWK FANS BECAUSE HERE'S
26:12,KAM CHANCELLOR'S FIRST SHOT
26:14,RUNNING DOWN THE FIELD AGAINST
26:16,GRONKOWSKI.
26:17,ALMOST CAME BACK UNDERNEATH AND
26:18,MADE THE PLAY.
26:19,BUT SO MANY TIMES WE SEE THIS
26:21,NEW ENGLAND OFFENSE REALLY GET A
26:24,JUMP START WHEN GRONKOWSKI
26:26,"STARTS TO GET INTO THE GAME, AND"
26:28,"SO FAR, NOT A FACTOR."
26:29, IN ALL OF BRADY'S
26:31,"SUPER BOWLS -- THREE WINS, TWO"
26:32,LOSSES -- ON PASSES THAT HE'S
26:34,THROWN MORE THAN 20 YARDS FROM
26:35,"THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE, HE'S 1"
26:37,FOR 22.
26:39,SO HE'S BEEN GREAT ON THE SHORT
26:41,STUFF.
26:41,HERE HE HANDS THE BALL OFF ON
26:42,SECOND DOWN.
26:43,IT GOES TO SHANE VEREEN.
26:46,TO THE 35-YARD LINE.
26:47,GAIN OF 1.
26:48,IT'LL BE THIRD DOWN.
26:51," WELL, SOME OF THE QUICKNESS"
26:53,NOW STARTING TO SHOW UP.
26:54,"AND FOR PETE CARROLL, HE HAS TO"
26:56,BE SO PROUD OF HIS DEFENSE.
26:58,YOU THINK OF WHAT THEY DID IN
27:00,THAT CHAMPIONSHIP GAME AGAINST
27:02,"GREEN BAY, SURVIVING ALL THOSE"
27:04,TURNOVERS.
27:05,"AND HERE COMES BENNETT AGAIN,"
27:07,"INSIDE, FLYING THROUGH THERE."
27:09,EVEN WHEN THEY'RE ON THE BACK
27:11,"SIDE, YOU HAVE TO BE READY FOR"
27:13,THAT QUICKNESS.
27:14, THIRD AND 9.
27:15,THIS WILL BE THE 26th PLAY RUN
27:17,BY NEW ENGLAND.
27:18,SEATTLE HAS RUN 8.
27:23,BRADY PROTECTED AGAIN.
27:25,THROWS -- CAUGHT ON THE RUN BY
27:26,EDELMAN.
27:27,HE'LL TAKE THE BALL TO ABOUT THE
27:29,10-YARD LINE.
27:31,JULIAN EDELMAN GETS FREE OVER
27:33,THE MIDDLE.
27:36,"ON A THIRD-AND-9 PLAY, THAT'S"
27:38,23 YARDS.
27:39, SO THE INJURY SHOWING UP
27:41,ALREADY HERE NOW.
27:42,JEREMY LANE WOULD BE IN THAT
27:44,POSITION.
27:45,NOW IT'S THAROLD SIMON.
27:46,AND JULIAN EDELMAN TOO QUICK.
27:48,SO YOU WONDERED WHETHER OR NOT
27:50,THEY WOULD ATTACK DOWN THE FIELD
27:52,AGAINST THE RICHARD SHERMANS.
27:54,"CLEARLY, THEY HAVE NOT TRIED TO"
27:55,DO ANY OF THAT.
27:56,"BUT THESE INSIDE ROUTES, THE"
27:58,QUICKNESS OF THOSE TWO GUYS --
28:00,"SHANE VEREEN, JULIAN EDELMAN --"
28:02,NOW SHOWING UP.
28:04, SO THE SECOND DEEP SURGE BY
28:05,NEW ENGLAND.
28:06,THE FIRST ENDED WITH THE
28:07,INTERCEPTION.
28:09,AND THIS IS BLOUNT GOING
28:11,NOWHERE.
28:12,GAIN OF 1 TO THE 11-YARD LINE.
28:15,IT WILL BE SECOND DOWN AND 9.
28:18, WE'VE GOT OUR FIRST LITTLE
28:20,TACKLE-ELIGIBLE PLAY HERE.
28:22,"OF COURSE, THAT WAS A BIG PART"
28:24,OF THE CONVERSATION EARLIER.
28:26,SO YOU GET CAMERON FLEMING IN
28:28,THERE.
28:28,HE WOULD HAVE BEEN ELIGIBLE.
28:30,THAT ONE'S JUST SORT OF A BLUFF.
28:31,WILL THEY COME BACK AND HAVE
28:33,SOME SORT OF A PLAY WHERE HE'S
28:35,"ELIGIBLE, RECEIVER'S INELIGIBLE?"
28:38,WE'VE SEEN THEM ALL FROM
28:39,JOSH McDANIELS.
28:40," YES, WE HAVE."
28:41,FLEMING OVER TWO DOZEN TIMES
28:43,REPORTING AS ELIGIBLE AGAINST
28:45,INDIANAPOLIS.
28:47,SECOND AND 9.
28:49,BRADY THROWS -- CAUGHT!
28:51,"LaFELL, TOUCHDOWN!"
28:59,"BRANDON LaFELL, FROM CAROLINA TO"
29:01,"NEW ENGLAND AS A FREE AGENT,"
29:04,"MAKES THE CATCH, AND NEW ENGLAND"
29:06,STRIKES FIRST.
29:09, GOING RIGHT AFTER
29:10,THAROLD SIMON.
29:11,YOU KNEW IT WAS GONNA HAPPEN.
29:12,"HARD SLANT INSIDE, AND THEN"
29:14,WATCH THE TAIL END OF THIS
29:17,PLAY.
29:17,IT IS EARL THOMAS THAT COMES
29:19,"OVER, AND SIMON ENDS UP HOLDING"
29:22,HIS ARM OR SHOULDER AFTER TAKING
29:24,THE BRUNT OF THAT HIT.
29:27,THEY DON'T HAVE MANY CORNERS
29:29,"LEFT TO PLAY, SO THEY NEED ALL"
29:31,THESE GUYS TO STAY HEALTHY.
29:32, GOSTKOWSKI FOR THE EXTRA
29:34,POINT.
29:35,SO BRADY PUTS SIMON IN THE
29:38,CROSSHAIRS.
29:40,IT'S THE GRAND CANYON STATE.
29:42,"ONE OF THE YOUNGER STATES,"
29:43,OBVIOUSLY.
29:44,THE 48th STATE.
29:45,ONLY HAWAII AND ALASKA HAVE BEEN
29:47,IN THE UNION A SHORTER PERIOD
29:50,OF TIME.
29:50,RUSSELL WILSON READY TO COME
29:52,BACK OUT.
29:53,NINE FIRST DOWNS FOR
29:55,"NEW ENGLAND, ONE FOR SEATTLE."
29:57,"TOTAL PLAYS, 28-8."
29:59,GOSTKOWSKI TO KICK OFF.
30:01,AND DOUG BALDWIN WILL MOVE TO
30:04,HIS RIGHT AND JUST LET IT FLOP
30:07,OUT OF THE END ZONE.
30:10,9:47 LEFT IN THE HALF.
30:13,WILSON READY TO TAKE OVER.
30:14,RAISED THE LOMBARDI TROPHY LAST
30:16,YEAR AND TOLD US WHEN HE PUT IT
30:17,"DOWN, ALL HE COULD THINK ABOUT"
30:19,WAS DOING IT AGAIN NEXT YEAR.
30:21,"WELL, HERE IS NEXT YEAR, AND"
30:23,HE'S GOING TO GET SACKED AGAIN
30:24,FOR THE SECOND TIME AT THE
30:25,18-YARD LINE.
30:27,CHANDLER JONES COMES IN TO TAKE
30:29,HIM DOWN TO MAKE IT SECOND DOWN
30:31,AND 12.
30:35, I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT
30:36,"HAPPENS HERE, BUT RUSSELL OKUNG"
30:37,"IS GONNA PULL OUT, AND"
30:39,CHANDLER JONES IS GOING TO END
30:40,"UP ON THE GUARD,"
30:41,JAMES CARPENTER.
30:42,"MARSHAWN LYNCH, WHEN HE WAS"
30:43,"COMING OUT FOR THE ROUTE, KIND"
30:45,OF KNOCKED CARPENTER OFF.
30:46,"SO, SO FAR HERE, RUSSELL WILSON"
30:48,HAS GOTTEN NOTHING GOING AT ALL.
30:50,SORT OF LIKE THE BEGINNING OF
30:51,THE CHAMPIONSHIP GAME AGAINST
30:53,GREEN BAY.
30:53,"0 FOR 4 IN THAT ONE,"
30:54,FOUR INTERCEPTIONS --
30:56,UNTIL FOUR MINUTES TO GO IN THE
30:57,"GAME, A QUARTERBACK RATING OF 7."
30:59, WILSON HASN'T COMPLETED A
31:00,PASS.
31:00,BRADY'S COMPLETED 14.
31:02,TO THE 21-YARD LINE GOES
31:04,LYNCH.
31:05,TACKLED THERE BY JAMIE COLLINS.
31:08,SETTING UP A THIRD DOWN AND
31:09,LONG.
31:10,MAKE IT THIRD AND 8.
31:11, ONE OF THE REALLY
31:13,"INTERESTING MOVES HERE, THEY'RE"
31:14,BRINGING JAMIE COLLINS HERE TO
31:16,THE MIDDLE OF THE FIELD BECAUSE
31:17,THEY WANTED TO BE ABLE TO GO
31:19,SIDELINE TO SIDELINE WITH HIM.
31:20,THE FEELING WAS THAT NOT ONLY
31:22,COULD HE END UP SNIFFING OUT THE
31:24,"RUNS OF MARSHAWN LYNCH, BUT IF"
31:26,RUSSELL WILSON STARTS TO GET
31:28,"LOOSE ON THE EDGE, HE COULD RUN"
31:29,"HIM DOWN, AS WELL."
31:31,A VERY SIGNIFICANT PLAYER IN
31:33,"THIS GAME, JAMIE COLLINS."
31:35, 8 1/2 LEFT IN THE HALF.
31:37,THIRD AND 8.
31:44,WILSON.
31:45,GOING DEEP DOWN THE SIDELINE.
31:47,AND BROKEN UP.
31:49,"LOGAN RYAN, THE NICKEL, KNOCKED"
31:52,IT AWAY FROM JERMAINE KEARSE.
31:54,AND IT'S ANOTHER QUICK
31:55,THREE-AND-OUT FOR THE SEAHAWKS.
31:57, YOU'RE GONNA ASK ME WHAT THE
31:59,STORY LINE OF THIS GAME HAS
32:01,BEEN SO FAR?
32:01,I WILL TELL YOU THE UTTER
32:03,DOMINATION IN MAN COVERAGE OF
32:04,THE PATRIOTS' COVERAGE PEOPLE
32:06,ALL OVER THE PLACE.
32:07,THERE'S BEEN NOWHERE TO THROW
32:09,THIS FOOTBALL.
32:10,I'VE BEEN WATCHING IT ON ALMOST
32:12,EVERY PLAY.
32:12,THERE JUST IS NOTHING THERE.
32:14,"THEY'RE SPYING, THEY'RE TAKING"
32:16,CARE OF RUSSELL WILSON IN CASE
32:17,"HE WANTS TO RUN, AND THE"
32:18,COVERAGE PEOPLE DOWN THE FIELD
32:20,ARE WINNING.
32:21, GAME IS ALMOST 22 MINUTES
32:22,"OLD, AND WILSON HAS NOT"
32:24,COMPLETED A PASS.
32:26,JON RYAN.
32:27,"GOOD, DEEP."
32:28,BEAUTIFUL KICK.
32:29,FIELDED AT THE 17 BY EDELMAN.
32:31,RUNS INTO HIS OWN MAN.
32:33,"AND THEN RUNS OUT OF ROOM, AND"
32:34,HE'S TAKEN OUT OF BOUNDS AT
32:35,ABOUT THE 27-YARD LINE.
32:39,"IT'S THE OLD ADAGE, DEFENSE"
32:41,WINS SUPER BOWLS.
32:43,THERE'S A LIST OF THE TEAMS THAT
32:45,LED THE LEAGUE IN FEWEST POINTS
32:47,AND YARDS ALLOWED.
32:49,AND ONLY THE CHIEFS IN THE LAST
32:51,SUPER BOWL BEFORE THE AFL-NFL
32:53,"MERGER WOULD HAVE LOST, BUT THEY"
32:55,LOST TO THE NFL's NUMBER-ONE
32:57,"DEFENSE, AS THE VIKINGS WERE"
33:00,NUMBER ONE.
33:01,THEY WERE THE TEAM THAT LOST TO
33:03,THE KANSAS CITY CHIEFS BACK IN
33:05,"SUPER BOWL IV, AND THEN THE"
33:06,MERGER TOOK PLACE THE NEXT YEAR.
33:08," DEFENSE CAN'T WIN ANYTHING,"
33:09,"THOUGH, IF YOUR OFFENSE ISN'T"
33:11,DOING ANYTHING ON THEIR SIDE.
33:13,"140-22, THE TOTAL YARDS."
33:15, CRAZY.
33:16, GOODNESS GRACIOUS.
33:17, THEY'VE GOT GRONKOWSKI
33:19,OUTSIDE.
33:19,LaFELL IS ON THE SLOT TO THE
33:20,LEFT.
33:23,WILL THEY START TO PICK ON SIMON
33:25,AGAIN?
33:25,EDELMAN NOW SETS UP ON THE LEFT
33:27,SIDE.
33:27,HE'S GOT THREE GUYS COMING OUT
33:28,OF THE LEFT SIDE.
33:29,"LOOKS THAT WAY, AND HAS IT"
33:31,BATTED DOWN AT THE LINE OF
33:32,SCRIMMAGE.
33:33,"IT'S TONY McDANIEL, 6'7"", 305,"
33:36,"OUT OF TENNESSEE, BATTING IT."
33:38,SECOND AND 10.
33:39," YEAH, AND I THINK THAT'S A"
33:41,GOOD STRATEGY BECAUSE NOW BRADY
33:43,HAS GOT THEM SO FRUSTRATED WITH
33:45,"THESE QUICK THROWS, YOU'RE NOT"
33:47,SEEING THE PASS RUSHERS OF
33:48,SEATTLE EVEN MAKING MOVES.
33:50,THEY'RE BASICALLY HAVING TO JUST
33:52,GO PUSH INTO THE OFFENSIVE
33:53,LINEMEN AND THEN TRY TO GET
33:54,THEIR HANDS UP BECAUSE THERE'S
33:56,NO WAY THEY'RE GONNA GET THERE.
34:01, THREE RECEIVERS ARE SET ON
34:03,THE LEFT SIDE AGAIN.
34:05,BRADY.
34:06,CHECKING THE MIDDLE.
34:07,THROWS.
34:08,CUTTING OVER THE MIDDLE IS
34:09,JULIAN EDELMAN.
34:11,THEY TACKLE HIM.
34:12,IT'LL BE THIRD DOWN AND 3.
34:13,"BOBBY WAGNER, THE MIDDLE"
34:14,LINEBACKER WHO WAS SO
34:15,INSTRUMENTAL IN THE SUCCESS OF
34:16,"THIS TEAM WHEN HE GOT HEALTHY,"
34:18,MAKES THE STOP.
34:19," ALL RIGHT, HERE'S"
34:20,BOBBY WAGNER RIGHT HERE.
34:21,AND WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS
34:23,THEY'RE RUNNING SHANE VEREEN OUT
34:24,OF THE BACKFIELD.
34:25,THEN THEY'RE RUNNING THE TIGHT
34:27,END OR SLOT ON THAT SIDE UP THE
34:29,SEAM.
34:29,SO ALL THEY'RE DOING IS CLEARING
34:31,OUT AN ENTIRE ZONE AND LEAVING
34:33,EDELMAN ONE-ON-ONE WITH
34:34,"BOBBY WAGNER, AND THEY ARE"
34:36,WINNING THE GAME WITH THAT
34:37,STRATEGY.
34:39, THIRD AND 3.
34:43,VEREEN.
34:44,MOTION TO THE INSIDE.
34:45,BRADY.
34:46,ESCAPING.
34:47,"TURNS THE SHOULDERS, AND THE"
34:49,PASS IS DEFLECTED AND
34:50,INCOMPLETE.
34:52,SO IT'S FOURTH DOWN.
34:57, LOOKED LIKE TOM BRADY WAS
34:59,"LOOKING DOWN THE FIELD, AND HIS"
35:01,"RECEIVER GOT KNOCKED DOWN, SO"
35:02,HE BASICALLY JUST TRIED TO HOLD
35:04,ON TO IT.
35:04,HE SAW HIS RECEIVER ON THE
35:06,GROUND.
35:06,COULDN'T TELL WHO THAT WAS.
35:08,MAYBE EDELMAN.
35:09,EVERY RECEIVER'S ON THE GROUND.
35:11,GRONKOWSKI AND EDELMAN KIND OF
35:13,RAN INTO EACH OTHER.
35:14,"BRADY SAID, ""I BETTER NOT THROW"
35:16,"THIS ONE."""
35:17, THAT'S THE FIRST
35:19,THREE-AND-OUT.
35:20,RYAN ALLEN TO PUNT.
35:23,BRYAN WALTERS SET TO RUN IT
35:25,BACK.
35:30,AND IT BOUNCES AT THE 29-YARD
35:32,LINE.
35:33, WHO'S HERE?
35:33,"WELL, JOHN TRAVOLTA."
35:35,THERE HE IS.
35:36,KEVIN HART.
35:38,SITTING NEXT TO WILL FERRELL.
35:40,A FEW JOKES IN THAT LUXURY
35:42,SUITE.
35:42,MARK WAHLBERG LOVES HIS
35:44,NEW ENGLAND TEAMS.
35:45,KENNY CHESNEY LOOKING ON.
35:47,STEVEN TYLER IS ALSO A HUGE
35:49,PATRIOT FAN.
35:50,"AND WE HAVE ROYALTY, AS WELL."
35:52,FROM LIVERPOOL.
35:54,PAUL McCARTNEY.
35:56,"NOW, FROM THE 30."
35:58,"THEY START THIS DRIVE, DO THE"
35:59,"SEAHAWKS, WITH LYNCH."
36:00,AND LYNCH WITH SOME TOUGH
36:02,RUNNING.
36:02,ALWAYS TOUGH RUNNING FROM
36:04,MARSHAWN.
36:05,UP TO THE 35-YARD LINE.
36:07,GAIN OF 5.
36:09,MATT PATRICIA IS THE DEFENSIVE
36:11,COORDINATOR.
36:12,HE'S DONE A GREAT JOB.
36:13,AND ONE OF THESE GUYS -- ONE OF
36:15,THESE GUYS WHO MAYBE NEXT YEAR
36:17,WILL BE IN LINE TO BE
36:19,INTERVIEWED FOR A HEAD-COACHING
36:21,SPOT.
36:21, SO MANY OF THESE RUNS OF
36:23,"MARSHAWN LYNCH, WHEN THEY START"
36:25,"LEFT, THEY GO BACK RIGHT."
36:26,AND THE PATRIOTS ARE KIND OF
36:28,CRASHING IN FROM THAT SIDE AND
36:30,TRYING TO TAKE AWAY THAT
36:32,"CUTBACK LANE, AND IT'S BEEN"
36:34,WORKING PRETTY WELL SO FAR.
36:35, SEE WHAT HAPPENS HERE.
36:37,"THIS TIME, STRAIGHT AHEAD."
36:38,BUT JUST BACKS HIS WAY FOR AN
36:40,"EXTRA YARD, YARD AND A HALF TO"
36:42,SET UP A THIRD DOWN AND SHORT.
36:50," DONT'A HIGHTOWER, RIGHT HERE,"
36:53,THE BIG GUY IN THE MIDDLE.
36:56,JUST GOING TO TRY TO COME IN
36:57,"THERE, AND THEY'RE JUST TRYING"
36:59,TO OCCUPY EVERY SINGLE LANE THAT
37:01,THERE IS.
37:02,JUST DON'T ALLOW THAT BIG GUY TO
37:04,"GET STARTED, BECAUSE WHEN HE"
37:05,"STARTS WITH THOSE JUMP CUTS,"
37:07,"HIGHTOWER, JAMIE COLLINS, NONE"
37:09,OF THEM ARE GONNA GET HIM.
37:10," THIRD DOWN, A YARD AND A"
37:11,HALF.
37:13,AND A WHISTLE HERE.
37:14,WE'VE HAD A PENALTY-FREE GAME.
37:16,"WE HAD ONE PENALTY, AND IT WAS"
37:17,DECLINED.
37:18,BILL VINOVICH WILL FINALLY
37:19,TAKE THE MIKE.
37:20, FALSE START.
37:22,"OFFENSE, NUMBER 82."
37:23,5-YARD PENALTY.
37:24,STILL SECOND DOWN.
37:26, SO A THIRD AND 1 BECOMES A
37:28,THIRD AND 6.
37:29,"THAT'S LUKE WILLSON, 82, THE"
37:31,TIGHT END.
37:34,THAT'S THE SECOND-LONGEST INTO A
37:36,GAME WITHOUT A COMPLETION.
37:37,"NEW ENGLAND IN SUPER BOWL XX,"
37:38,GOING ALL THE WAY BACK.
37:41,THAT WAS AGAINST THE '85 BEARS.
37:45,THEY GOT THEIR FIRST COMPLETION
37:46,WITH FIVE MINUTES TO GO IN THE
37:48,HALF.
37:50,"WE HAVE 5:44 HERE, BUT A THIRD"
37:52,DOWN AND 6 NOW.
37:55,FROM THE 34-YARD LINE.
37:57,TO THE OUTSIDE.
37:58,CAUGHT.
37:59,CAN HE GET THE FIRST DOWN?
38:00,"WELL, WE'LL SEE WHERE THEY SPOT"
38:01,IT.
38:02,THEY'RE GOING TO GIVE HIM A
38:03,"PRETTY GOOD SPOT HERE, AS"
38:04,BROWNER IS ABLE TO TACKLE
38:05,KEARSE.
38:06,AND THEY'RE GOING TO SPOT IT
38:08,"RIGHT AT THE 40, AND THAT WILL"
38:10,BE A FIRST DOWN.
38:13, AND DESPERATELY NEEDED.
38:14,"HERE AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN,"
38:16,GOING AGAINST BRANDON BROWNER --
38:17,"OF COURSE, FORMER MEMBER OF THE"
38:19,LEGION OF BOOM.
38:20,DOES HE GET THAT THING TURNED
38:21,OVER?
38:21,I THINK HE DOES.
38:22,PRETTY GOOD SPOT THERE.
38:24,AND THAT WAS A BIG ONE.
38:25,"YOU GET THE PENALTY, YOU GET"
38:26,KNOCKED BACK FROM A THIRD AND
38:28,"1, AND FINALLY RUSSELL WILSON"
38:29,STEPS UP AND MAKES A PLAY.
38:31, SO KEARSE CATCHES WILSON'S
38:35,FIRST COMPLETION.
38:37,AND NOW LYNCH TO THE 45.
38:38,YOU LOOK AT THESE SEATTLE
38:40,"RECEIVERS, CRIS, IT'S A"
38:42,FUNNY GROUP.
38:42,THEY DON'T GET A LOT OF
38:44,HEADLINES.
38:45,NONE OF THEM WERE DRAFTED.
38:46,NONE.
38:47,"REMEMBER LAST YEAR, THEY HAD"
38:48,GOLDEN TATE.
38:49,HE WENT TO DETROIT.
38:50,THEY HAD PERCY HARVIN.
38:51,THEY THOUGHT HE WOULD BE A STAR
38:52,"THIS YEAR FOR THEM, AND THEN HE"
38:54,"RAN HIS WAY OUT OF SEATTLE, AND"
38:55,THEY TRADED HIM TO THE
38:57,NEW YORK JETS.
38:57,"PAUL RICHARDSON, A ROOKIE, GOT"
38:59,HURT.
38:59,SO ALL FIVE OF THE GUYS WHO ARE
39:01,RECEIVERS ARE FREE AGENTS.
39:03, AND THEY GET UPSET WHEN
39:05,ANYBODY SAYS NEGATIVE THINGS
39:07,ABOUT THEM.
39:08,BUT HERE'S THEIR MOMENT.
39:09,THIS IS WHEN THEY'RE GONNA HAVE
39:10,TO WIN THE GAME.
39:11,"AND LUKE WILLSON NEEDS TO HELP,"
39:12,AS WELL.
39:15, THE FAKE.
39:16,"WILSON, WHO HAS GOT A GREAT ARM."
39:18,"DOWNFIELD, TURNING AND MAKING"
39:20,THE CATCH!
39:21,TWISTING AND TURNING IS
39:22,CHRIS MATTHEWS.
39:25,ANOTHER OF THOSE FREE AGENTS.
39:27,A GUY WHO HAS PLAYED VERY LITTLE
39:29,"OFFENSE THIS YEAR, BUT THE GUY"
39:31,WHO RECOVERED THAT ONSIDE KICK
39:32,THAT WAS SO HUGE IN THE NFC
39:34,CHAMPIONSHIP GAME.
39:36," AND HE'S A BIG GUY, AL."
39:37,REMEMBER WATCHING IN PRACTICE
39:39,"THE OTHER DAY, HOW GREAT"
39:40,RUSSELL WILSON WAS AT THROWING
39:42,THE DEEP BALL?
39:43,FINALLY NOW HE GETS ONE
39:44,"COMPLETION, THEY TAKE A SHOT --"
39:46,AND NOW THE SUBSTITUTION IS
39:48,HAPPENING AND THE REFEREES ARE
39:49,HOLDING UP PLAY SO THEY CAN'T
39:51,GET THAT QUICK SNAP.
39:52, THEY RACE TO THE LINE.
39:54,HERE'S LYNCH.
39:55,AND LYNCH TAKES THE BALL TO THE
39:57,"7 AS THE CROWD CHANTS ""BEAST"" --"
39:59,AT LEAST THE SEATTLE PORTION.
40:00,ANOTHER LOOK AT THE CATCH BY
40:02,"CHRIS MATTHEWS, WHO DID NOT"
40:04,CATCH A PASS THIS SEASON.
40:06, LOOK AT THAT.
40:07,HOW ABOUT THAT ONE?
40:08,"ARRINGTON ALL OVER HIM, IN"
40:09,PERFECT COVERAGE.
40:11,BUT THE ONE THING I LOVE
40:12,WATCHING WITH RUSSELL WILSON --
40:14,NOT ONLY DOES HE THROW THE DEEP
40:16,"BALL WELL, BUT HE THROWS THEM"
40:17,HIGH.
40:18,HE HAS ENOUGH STRENGTH IN HIS
40:19,"ARM TO GET IT UP HIGH SO A BIG,"
40:22,TALL RECEIVER LIKE MATTHEWS CAN
40:24,GO UP AND GET IT.
40:26, TUKUAFU IS NOW IN THE GAME AT
40:28,FULLBACK TO PROVIDE LEVERAGE FOR
40:30,LYNCH.
40:30,HERE GOES LYNCH TO THE LEFT
40:32,SIDE.
40:33,HE GETS IT DOWN TO THE 2-YARD
40:35,LINE.
40:35,CHANDLER JONES MAKES THE TACKLE.
40:37,IT WILL BE THIRD DOWN AND A LONG
40:38,YARD.
40:40," I TELL YOU WHAT,"
40:41,CHANDLER JONES JUST TOOK THE
40:42,HELMET RIGHT OFF OF
40:43,JAMES CARPENTER ON THAT ONE.
40:44,THERE IS SOME FIGHTS GOING ON
40:46,INSIDE IN THIS FOOTBALL GAME.
40:48,THIS IS JUST MAN ON MAN.
40:50,HERE WE GO RIGHT HERE.
40:53,"I MEAN, THIS IS UP AND DOWN THE"
40:55,LINE.
40:55,YOU CAN ALMOST PICK OUT ANY
40:56,BATTLE YOU WANT TO SEE.
40:57,"HIGHTOWER, JAMIE COLLINS,"
40:59,CHANDLER JONES.
41:00,IT'S LIKE THAT ALL THE WAY UP
41:01,AND DOWN THIS LINE.
41:04, THIRD AND 2 FROM THE 3.
41:09,WILSON.
41:11,TO LYNCH.
41:12,TOUCHDOWN!
41:18,"MARSHAWN LYNCH, WHO LED THE"
41:21,LEAGUE IN TOUCHDOWNS THIS SEASON
41:24,WITH 17.
41:25,13 ON THE GROUND.
41:26,IT'S ALL SET UP BY THE PASS TO
41:28,MATTHEWS.
41:28,AND WE'RE AN EXTRA POINT AWAY
41:30,FROM A TIE GAME.
41:31, ONCE YOU GET VINCE WILFORK
41:33,CONTAINED -- THEY GET THE
41:34,"DOUBLE-TEAM ON HIM, AND THEN"
41:36,WE'VE SEEN IT SO MANY TIMES --
41:38,"MARSHAWN LYNCH, YOU GIVE HIM A"
41:40,LITTLE SPACE.
41:41,"THEY HIT THE BIG PASS, AND NOW"
41:42,THE RUNNING GAME FINALLY OPENS
41:44,UP.
41:44,"AND SEATTLE, AFTER DOING"
41:46,"NOTHING, ANSWERS IN A BIG WAY."
41:48, YOU GOT A LITTLE BRAWL.
41:50,HELMETS FLYING OFF ON JUST ABOUT
41:51,EVERY PLAY.
41:52, WE GOT A SUPER BOWL GOING
41:53,NOW.
41:54, YEP.
41:56," AND JUST LIKE GREEN BAY, YOU"
41:57,"WONDER, DOES IT COME BACK TO"
41:59,"HAUNT THEM IN SOME WAY, NOT"
42:01,BEING ABLE TO CONVERT EARLY IN
42:02,THIS GAME?
42:03, MM-HMM.
42:04,"MEANWHILE, DONT'A HIGHTOWER GOT"
42:05,"HURT, AND HE'S BEING ASSISTED"
42:07,OFF THE FIELD.
42:08,"THERE'S THE LINEBACKER, RIGHT"
42:09,THERE.
42:10,BACK TO THE BENCH HE GOES.
42:14,"2:16 LEFT IN A VERY, VERY FAST"
42:18,FIRST HALF.
42:19,A LOT OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE
42:21,FACT WE'VE HAD ONLY ONE
42:22,ACCEPTED PENALTY.
42:24,AND ONE DECLINED PENALTY.
42:26," WELL, IF YOU'RE A PATRIOTS"
42:28,"FAN, DONT'A HIGHTOWER COULD NOT"
42:30,BE MORE SIGNIFICANT IN THIS
42:32,FOOTBALL GAME BECAUSE OF
42:34,MARSHAWN LYNCH.
42:37, HIGHTOWER BATTLING A
42:38,SHOULDER INJURY FOR MUCH OF THE
42:40,SEASON.
42:41,"THAT WAS A 70-YARD, 8-PLAY"
42:44,DRIVE.
42:45,"SIX RUSHES, TWO PASSES."
42:48,EXTRA POINT BY HAUSCHKA IS GOOD.
42:51,LOOKING DOWN THROUGH THE HOLE IN
42:54,"THE ROOF, THE RETRACTABLE ROOF."
42:56,THEY GROW THE GRASS OUTSIDE AND
42:58,THEN WHEEL IT IN.
43:00,THE GRASS IS GROWN IN ALABAMA.
43:02,BUNCH OF TRUCKS BROUGHT IT IN.
43:03, HOME OF?
43:04, HERE YOU GO -- HOME OF
43:06,KEN STABLER.
43:07,"FOLEY, ALABAMA."
43:08, THERE YOU GO.
43:10, DOWN BY THE GULF.
43:14,"SO, SO MUCH MADE ABOUT THE"
43:16,FOOTBALLS AND WHERE THEY'D BE
43:18,AND UNDER LOCK AND KEY.
43:19,AND THEY'VE BEEN WELL TAKEN CARE
43:21,OF.
43:21,THERE THEY ARE.
43:22,ALL OF THEM 12.5 TO 13.5 POUNDS.
43:24,"CRIS, I WAS THINKING, YOU KNEW"
43:26,NEIL ARMSTRONG -- NOT SINCE
43:27,ARMSTRONG STEPPED ON THE MOON
43:28,HAVE MORE ASTROPHYSICISTS BEEN
43:30,INTERVIEWED ON TELEVISION THAN
43:31,THIS WEEK.
43:32, [ LAUGHS ]
43:33, I THINK WE KNOW ALL WE EVER
43:34,NEED TO KNOW ABOUT POUNDS PER
43:36,SQUARE INCH.
43:36," I TELL YOU, THAT WAS AN"
43:38,INTERESTING DAY WITH THE
43:39,"PATRIOTS THIS WEEK, THOUGH,"
43:40,WASN'T IT?
43:41," OH, YEAH."
43:41, I COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE
43:43,DIRECT WITH MY QUESTIONING OF
43:46,"BILL BELICHICK, TOM BRADY,"
43:47,ROBERT KRAFT.
43:48,THEY ALL ABSOLUTELY DENIED ANY
43:50,"KNOWLEDGE, ANY INVOLVEMENT, ANY"
43:53,"POSSIBILITY, ANYTHING THEY SAID"
43:55,COULD HAVE LED TO INTENTIONALLY
43:57,DEFLATING THOSE BALLS.
43:58, YOU SAW ROBERT AND
43:59,JONATHAN KRAFT.
44:00,INVESTIGATION IS ONGOING.
44:04,BOB KRAFT PUT ALL OF HIS CHIPS
44:05,ON THE TABLE WHEN HE SAID HE
44:07,WANTED AN APOLOGY FROM THE
44:08,LEAGUE WHEN THEY FOUND OUT
44:09,THERE WAS NOTHING THERE.
44:11,"MEANWHILE, AMENDOLA, BEFORE HE"
44:12,"STEPS OUT OF BOUNDS, PICKS UP"
44:13,THE FIRST DOWN AT THE 31-YARD
44:15,LINE.
44:16,SO IT ALL STARTED -- YOU ALL
44:19,KNOW IT.
44:19,"I MEAN, UNLESS YOU WERE, I DON'T"
44:22,"KNOW, SOMEPLACE, SOME OTHER"
44:24,"PLANET, BUT THE DEFLATED"
44:25,FOOTBALLS WHICH THEY DISCOVERED
44:28,AT HALFTIME IN THE INDIANAPOLIS
44:30,"GAME, AND ALL OF THE WACKINESS"
44:32,AND CRAZINESS THAT LED UP TO
44:34,TONIGHT.
44:35,QUARTERBACK COMPARISON.
44:36,WEIRD NUMBERS.
44:37,BRADY WITH A LOT OF SHORT STUFF.
44:39,AND THEN THE ONE PASS TO LaFELL
44:41,GOT THEM INTO THE END ZONE.
44:42,AND THEN WILSON DID NOT COMPLETE
44:44,A PASS UNTIL THAT LAST DRIVE.
44:46,HAD THE 6-YARDER TO KEARSE AND
44:47,THEN THE 44-YARDER TO MATTHEWS.
44:49,"JUST TWO COMPLETIONS, BUT THAT"
44:51,SET UP LYNCH TO GET INTO THE END
44:53,ZONE.
44:53,"THUS AT THE 2-MINUTE WARNING,"
44:55,WE ARE KNOTTED AT 7.
44:58, THIS IS WHEN THE PATRIOTS ARE
44:59,AT THEIR BEST.
45:00,THEY LED THE NFL WITH 66 POINTS
45:02,IN THE FINAL 2 MINUTES OF THE
45:04,FIRST HALF.
45:05,LET'S SEE WHAT THEY CAN DO HERE.
45:07, AND THEY HAVE ALL OF THEIR
45:09,TIME-OUTS.
45:10,STARTING THE DRIVE FROM THE
45:11,31-YARD LINE.
45:12,BEGIN ON THE GROUND.
45:14,BLOUNT.
45:15,AVOIDING TACKLERS.
45:16,FIGHTING HIS WAY FOR A FIRST
45:19,DOWN.
45:20,GETS TO THE 41-YARD LINE.
45:22,SEE WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO MARK
45:23,"IT, THOUGH."
45:23,THEY'RE GOING TO MARK IT A
45:24,LITTLE BIT SHORT.
45:25,INCHES SHORT.
45:27,SECOND AND INCHES.
45:28, THEY'VE BEEN STARTING A LOT
45:30,OF THESE DRIVES WITH
45:31,CAMERON FLEMING IN AT TIGHT END.
45:32,THAT TIME THEY RAN RIGHT BEHIND
45:34,HIM.
45:35,GREAT DRIVE START.
45:38, SECOND AND INCHES.
45:40,BRADY FLIPS IT QUICKLY.
45:42,THAT CONVERTS.
45:43,VEREEN GETS TAKEN DOWN.
45:44,"BOBBY WAGNER, THE LINEBACKER,"
45:46,COVERING HIM ON THE OUTSIDE.
45:47,FIRST DOWN.
45:48, THAT'S WHAT THEY'VE BEEN
45:50,DOING.
45:51,THEY'VE BEEN TAKING VEREEN RIGHT
45:53,OUT OF THE BACKFIELD AND THEN
45:54,WORKING HIM WIDE AND CREATING
45:56,"SOME SPACE INSIDE, SO THAT TIME"
45:58,THEY FINALLY THROW IT TO HIM.
46:09, TICKING DOWN TO A MINUTE.
46:13,BRADY.
46:14,GOOD PROTECTION.
46:15,DEEP ON THE OUTSIDE.
46:16,AND OVER THE HEAD -- AND
46:18,INCOMPLETE -- OF DANNY AMENDOLA.
46:20,BYRON MAXWELL COVERING.
46:21,SECOND AND 10 FOR THE PATRIOTS.
46:25,"PATRIOTS, 66 POINTS IN THE FINAL"
46:31,2 MINUTES OF THE FIRST HALF.
46:33," AL, YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY"
46:35,GRONKOWSKI HASN'T BEEN MUCH OF
46:36,A FACTOR -- WE'RE STARTING TO
46:38,SEE SOME OF THESE LURK COVERAGES
46:40,WHERE KAM CHANCELLOR NOW IS
46:42,WALKING DOWN INTO THE MIDDLE OF
46:43,THE FIELD WITH REALLY NO
46:45,RESPONSIBILITY -- NUMBER 31.
46:47,AND SO IF GRONKOWSKI COMES ON
46:48,"ONE OF THOSE CROSSING ROUTES,"
46:50,HE'S RIGHT THERE TO PICK IT UP.
46:54, THE DEFENSE CROWDING THE
46:56,"LINE, AS SHERMAN'S GOING TO GO"
46:58,"TO THE OUTSIDE, MIRRORING"
46:59,"EDELMAN, WHO GETS IT, AND THEN"
47:01,HE'S JUST TRIPPED UP AFTER A
47:03,SHORT GAIN.
47:05,YOU HAD EDELMAN GOING ACROSS THE
47:07,FORMATION AND SHERMAN FOLLOWING
47:09,HIM.
47:09," THE OLD JET SWEEP, RIGHT?"
47:11,"YOU JUST TURN AROUND, AND IT'S"
47:12,RIGHT THERE.
47:13,"AND THEN BRUCE IRVIN, AS"
47:14,"ATHLETIC AS HE IS, HE JUST CAN'T"
47:16,REACT TO IT THAT QUICKLY.
47:17,NICE TO HAVE SOMEBODY LIKE A
47:19,JULIAN EDELMAN ON YOUR TEAM THAT
47:21,CAN DO SO MANY THINGS.
47:22,"OF COURSE, ONE OF THE BIG PLAYS"
47:25,OF THIS PLAYOFF RUN WAS HIS
47:27,TOUCHDOWN PASS ON THAT DOUBLE
47:29,PASS TO DANNY AMENDOLA.
47:33, IN THE GAME AGAINST
47:34,"BALTIMORE, WHERE THEY ERASED TWO"
47:36,14-POINT DEFICITS.
47:37,THIRD AND 3.
47:38,OH!
47:38,AND JUMPING ACROSS -- AND THEY
47:40,WHISTLE IT DEAD BECAUSE HE
47:42,COULD HAVE GONE UNABATED TO THE
47:43,QUARTERBACK -- WAS CLIFF AVRIL.
47:45,SO HE'S OFFSIDE.
47:47,AND THAT IS A FREE FIRST DOWN.
47:52," NEUTRAL-ZONE INFRACTION,"
47:53,"DEFENSE, NUMBER 56."
47:55,5-YARD PENALTY.
47:57,STILL THIRD DOWN.
47:59, IT JUST DOESN'T GET WORSE
48:01,THAN THAT.
48:01,WHEN YOU'RE IN A THIRD AND LESS
48:03,"THAN 5, EVERYBODY ON THAT"
48:05,DEFENSIVE LINE SHOULD BE
48:06,"YELLING, ""DON'T JUMP, DON'T"
48:08,"JUMP, DON'T JUMP!"""
48:09,"AND THEN IT'S THE VETERAN,"
48:10,"CLIFF AVRIL, WHO WAS SO BIG, I"
48:12,"THOUGHT, IN THE GAME AGAINST"
48:13,PEYTON MANNING LAST YEAR BUT
48:15,REALLY HAS BEEN A NONFACTOR SO
48:16,FAR HERE.
48:17, SEAHAWKS WERE THE MOST
48:18,PENALIZED TEAM IN THE LEAGUE
48:20,THIS SEASON.
48:22,AND THEIR OPPONENTS DREW FEWER
48:23,PENALTIES.
48:24,IT WAS LIKE A 2-TO-1 RATIO FOR
48:26,"THE SEAHAWKS THIS YEAR, THEIR"
48:28,PENALTIES AGAINST THE
48:30,OPPOSITION.
48:31,COSTLY ONE THERE.
48:32,THE BALL AT THE 44.
48:33,FIRST DOWN.
48:41,BRADY.
48:43,"LOW THROW, BUT CAUGHT."
48:45,OFF THE SHOE TOPS OF
48:47,"SHANE VEREEN, WHO GETS THE BALL"
48:49,TO THE 26-YARD LINE.
48:52,NEW ENGLAND WITH ALL OF ITS
48:53,"TIME-OUTS, AND THEY WILL ELECT"
48:55,TO USE THEIR FIRST RIGHT HERE.
48:59," THERE WE GO, OUT OF THE"
49:01,BACKFIELD.
49:01,"AGAIN, CLEAR THE SPACE, CLEAR"
49:03,THE ZONE.
49:04,ONE-ON-ONE ROUTE.
49:05,JUST LET THEM GO TO WORK.
49:06,THEY'RE DROPPING DOWN
49:07,EARL THOMAS THAT TIME IN THE
49:09,"MIDDLE OF THE FIELD, BUT HE JUST"
49:11,COULDN'T QUITE GET THERE.
49:12,YOU'RE GOING TO WIN THAT BATTLE
49:14,AGAINST A LINEBACKER LIKE
49:16,"BOBBY WAGNER, BUT EARL THOMAS"
49:18,KIND OF GOT PICKED OFF AND MIGHT
49:20,HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET THERE.
49:22, COMING UP ON THE TOYOTA
49:23,"HALFTIME REPORT, THE GUYS WILL"
49:25,"BREAK DOWN THE FIRST HALF, TELL"
49:26,YOU WHAT EACH TEAM NEEDS TO DO
49:28,IN THE SECOND HALF.
49:29,TWO COACHES WHO CERTAINLY KNOW
49:32,HOW TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS.
49:34,COMING UP ON THE TOYOTA
49:36,HALFTIME.
49:37,BILL BELICHICK.
49:38,HE'S WON MORE POSTSEASON GAMES
49:40,THAN ANY COACH IN HISTORY.
49:41,21
49:43,20 OF THOSE WITH THE PATRIOTS.
49:44,YOU FORGET HE WON ONE OF THOSE
49:45,WITH THE CLEVELAND BROWNS.
49:48,COACHED THERE FOR FIVE YEARS AND
49:51,WENT TO NEW ENGLAND IN 2000.
49:53,YOU GOT GRONKOWSKI MATCHED UP
49:55,WITH SHERMAN AT THE BOTTOM OF
49:57,THE SCREEN.
50:00,AND THE PASS IS FLIPPED TO THE
50:02,OUTSIDE FOR A SHORT GAIN.
50:03,VEREEN GETS SHOVED OUT OF
50:04,BOUNDS.
50:06,AND IT WILL BE SECOND DOWN.
50:09," YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE PROBLEMS"
50:11,"IS, IF THEY KEEP GOING TO THESE"
50:13,"QUICK PLAYS, YOU HAVE THE"
50:15,"OPTION, IF YOU'RE SEATTLE, TO"
50:16,MAYBE BRING IN SOME EXTRA
50:18,"CORNERS, BUT BECAUSE OF THE"
50:19,"INJURY TO JEREMY LANE, REALLY,"
50:21,IT'S THAROLD SIMON -- THEY'RE
50:23,ALL OUT THERE ON THE FIELD
50:24,ALREADY.
50:25,SO OPTIONS LIMITED.
50:26,SO RIGHT NOW THE PATRIOTS
50:27,"SAYING, ""WE'RE GOING TO STAY"
50:29,WITH THIS SPREAD-OUT LOOK AND
50:30,ALL THESE RECEIVERS BECAUSE WE
50:32,LIKE THE DEFENSIVE BACKS ON THE
50:34,"FIELD RIGHT NOW THAT THEY HAVE."""
50:35," MEANWHILE, YOU HAVE"
50:36,SHERMAN -- YOU CAN SEE HIM.
50:37,HE'S IN THE SLOT.
50:40,AND BRADY'S GOING TO THROW DEEP
50:42,DOWN THE RIGHT SIDE FOR
50:43,GRONKOWSKI.
50:44,AND A TOUCHDOWN!
50:53,AND THE EARTHQUAKE SPIKE.
50:56,"SEE, YOU'VE GOT THE LINEBACKER"
50:58,COVERING HIM.
50:59,AND GRONKOWSKI IS ABLE TO HAUL
51:02,IT IN.
51:02,K.J. WRIGHT COULDN'T HANG WITH
51:04,HIM.
51:04,22 YARDS FOR THE SCORE.
51:06," AL, IT'S AMAZING, IS THAT"
51:08,THE PATRIOTS KNEW COMING INTO
51:10,THIS GAME THAT IF K.J. WRIGHT
51:12,"WALKED OUT, HE WAS GONNA BE"
51:14,ABOUT 8 YARDS OFF AND WAY
51:16,"INSIDE, AND THAT SIGNALED MAN"
51:18,COVERAGE.
51:19,IT ALWAYS SIGNALS MAN COVERAGE
51:20,WHEN THEY'RE IN THERE.
51:22,THERE WAS NO DOUBT AT THE SNAP
51:23,OF THE BALL WHERE THAT ONE WAS
51:25,GOING.
51:25,"GRONKOWSKI AGAINST K.J. WRIGHT,"
51:28,A MISMATCH.
51:29,"CHANCELLOR, MAYBE."
51:31,THAT ONE WON'T WORK.
51:34, 1:45 -- THEY WENT 80 YARDS IN
51:35,EIGHT PLAYS.
51:37,GOSTKOWSKI FOR THE EXTRA POINT.
51:40,"WELL, THAT WOULD FIGURE."
51:41,MOST CAREER T.D. PASSES IN A
51:43,SUPER BOWL -- JOE MONTANA AND
51:45,TOM BRADY EACH WITH 11.
51:48,TWO TONIGHT FOR TOM.
51:53," HAD THE ONE MISTAKE EARLY,"
51:55,AND SINCE THEN HAS BEEN RAZOR
51:57,"SHARP, HASN'T HE?"
51:58, MM-HMM.
51:58,"20 OF 27, 177."
52:00,"A LOT OF SHORT STUFF, BUT TWICE"
52:02,HE'S GONE LONG AND IT'S PAID OFF
52:06,FOR HIM.
52:06,LaFELL AND GRONKOWSKI.
52:10, AMAZING THAT THE BIG
52:12,INTERCEPTION BY JEREMY LANE
52:14,COULD HAVE ACTUALLY TURNED THE
52:16,GAME IN FAVOR OF THE PATRIOTS.
52:19,"HE GOES OUT, AND ALL OF A"
52:21,SUDDEN THEY DON'T SEEM TO BE
52:22,QUITE THE COVERAGE TEAM.
52:24, GREAT POINT.
52:25,LOSE A GUY LIKE THAT.
52:29,TRY TO WORK AROUND IT.
52:31,AND NOW THIS WILL BE OUT OF THE
52:33,BACK OF THE END ZONE.
52:35,"SO WITH 31 SECONDS, THEY HAVE"
52:36,ALL OF THEIR TIME-OUTS -- NOT
52:37,THAT THEY'LL BE ABLE TO GET THEM
52:38,"IN WITH 31 SECONDS, BUT LET'S"
52:39,SEE IF WILSON CAN GET THEM INTO
52:41,FIELD-GOAL RANGE.
52:43, NATE SOLDER RIGHT THERE.
52:45,HANDLED THE SPIN MOVE PRETTY
52:46,MUCH.
52:47,"AND THEN ON THE OTHER SIDE,"
52:49,SEBASTIAN VOLLMER GOING AGAINST
52:51,MICHAEL BENNETT.
52:52,BUT THE BALL IS OUT OF THERE SO
52:54,"QUICKLY, HE KNEW PRESNAP ALL HE"
52:56,WAS GOING TO DO WAS LOOK OFF THE
52:58,SAFETY.
52:58,IT WAS SO EASY TO READ THE
53:00,COVERAGE.
53:00,AND THE ONE THING ABOUT THE
53:02,"SEAHAWKS IS, THEY DON'T CHANGE."
53:04,THEY NEVER CHANGE.
53:05,YOU KNOW WHICH COVERAGE THEY'RE
53:07,"IN, AND I DON'T THINK THEY CARE."
53:08, ROBERT TURBIN NOW IN THE
53:10,GAME.
53:11,WILSON.
53:13,HE'S GONNA GIVE IT TO TURBIN.
53:15,AND TURBIN'S GONNA GET FREE AND
53:17,TAKE IT OUT TO THE 39.
53:19,IT'S A 19-YARD GAIN.
53:21,SEATTLE WILL TAKE A TIME-OUT
53:23,HERE.
53:23,"MEANWHILE, BACK TO THE LAST"
53:25,"DRIVE, CRIS, HOW BIG WAS THE"
53:26,JUMPING OFFSIDE OF CLIFF AVRIL?
53:28,THAT WAS A THIRD DOWN AND 3 AT
53:29,THAT POINT.
53:30," YEAH, I MEAN, YOU DON'T KNOW."
53:32,"I MEAN, IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THEY"
53:33,WOULD HAVE PICKED IT UP ANYWAY?
53:35,POSSIBLY.
53:36,BUT ONE THING YOU DO NOT WANT TO
53:38,DO IS MAKE ANYTHING TOO EASY ON
53:40,TOM BRADY.
53:41," SO, TOM BRADY, 20 OF 27"
53:44,AFTER THE WACKIEST TWO WEEKS OF
53:47,HIS CAREER.
53:52,37
53:54,WE ALL KNOW THE STORY.
53:56,DRAFTED IN THE SIXTH ROUND.
53:58,HE WAS THE 199th PICK.
53:59,GOT A CHANCE TO START IN 2001
54:01,WHEN DREW BLEDSOE GOT HURT IN A
54:02,GAME AGAINST THE JETS.
54:04,THAT WAS BELICHICK'S SECOND
54:05,YEAR.
54:06,AND THE REST IS HISTORY.
54:09,AND HE'S WRITTEN MOST OF IT.
54:13,24 SECONDS.
54:16,FROM THE 39 NOW.
54:22,WILSON.
54:24,GETTING AWAY.
54:26,AND WILSON IS OUT OF BOUNDS AT
54:28,THE 45-YARD LINE.
54:29,SO NOW YOU HAVE 17 SECONDS.
54:31,HAUSCHKA IS THEIR FIELD-GOAL
54:33,KICKER.
54:34,"GOOD RANGE, BUT HAUSCHKA DID"
54:35,MISS THREE FIELD GOALS IN THIS
54:37,STADIUM AGAINST ARIZONA IN
54:39,DECEMBER.
54:40," JAMIE COLLINS, ONE OF THE"
54:41,MOST ATHLETIC DEFENDERS THE
54:43,"PATRIOTS HAVE, COULD NOT GET A"
54:44,HAND ON RUSSELL WILSON.
54:46,"AND THE SAD PART ABOUT IT IS,"
54:47,ALL THE PATRIOTS HAVE BEEN
54:49,"TALKING ABOUT THIS WEEK, IN THE"
54:50,FINAL 2 MINUTES OF THE HALF OR
54:52,"THE GAME, OR IN BIG MOMENTS,"
54:54,"BELIEVE ME, RUSSELL WILSON'S"
54:55,GONNA PULL THE BALL DOWN AND
54:57,"RUN WITH IT, AND THEY STILL LET"
54:58,HIM GET OUT.
54:59, 17 SECONDS.
55:00,THEY NEED ABOUT 10 YARDS OR SO
55:02,AND EITHER A TIME-OUT OR OUT OF
55:04,BOUNDS.
55:05,WILSON.
55:07,ROLLING AWAY.
55:08,AND THEN HE HAS TO THROW IT
55:09,AWAY.
55:09,SO NOW YOU GET DOWN TO THE MATH.
55:11,YOU GOT 11 SECONDS.
55:13,YOU CAN STILL USE ALL OF THE
55:15,FIELD BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE
55:16,TIME-OUTS.
55:17,"HAUSCHKA'S HAD A GOOD YEAR, BUT"
55:18,"HAUSCHKA, AS I SAID -- WE DID A"
55:20,SUNDAY-NIGHT GAME HERE IN
55:21,"DECEMBER, AND HE MISSED THREE"
55:23,FIELD GOALS.
55:25, AND ONLY MISSED SIX ALL YEAR.
55:29,"YOU JUST WONDER -- GOLF, RIGHT?"
55:30,"THERE'S A FEW HOLES, YOU STAND"
55:32,"THERE ON THE TEE, AND YOU GO,"
55:33,"""I'M NOT FEELING TOO GOOD ABOUT"
55:34,"THIS ONE."""
55:35,WONDER IF IT HAPPENS TO
55:36,"FIELD-GOAL KICKERS, TOO."
55:37, HAPPENED RIGHT HERE TO
55:38,TIGER WOODS ON THURSDAY AND
55:39,"FRIDAY, DIDN'T IT?"
55:40, SURE DID.
55:43, SECOND AND 10 NOW.
55:48,WILSON.
55:49,THROWING.
55:50,AND THAT WILL BE CAUGHT.
55:51,AND THAT WILL SET THEM UP FOR A
55:53,FIELD GOAL.
55:53,BUT A FLAG HERE.
55:54,RICARDO LOCKETTE MAKES THE
55:56,CATCH.
55:58,BUT IT'S THE FIRST TIME WE'VE
55:59,HAD A FLAG IN THE SECONDARY.
56:04,IF IT'S HOLDING AGAINST THE
56:06,"DEFENSE, THEY'LL DECLINE THAT,"
56:09,PUT THEM INTO FIELD-GOAL RANGE.
56:11,6 SECONDS.
56:12,YOU HAD --
56:13," PERSONAL FOUL, FACE MASK."
56:15,"DEFENSE, NUMBER 25."
56:18,THAT PENALTY WILL BE ADDED ONTO
56:19,"THE END OF THE RUN, HALF THE"
56:21,DISTANCE TO THE GOAL.
56:22,AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN.
56:23, SO THAT'S AT THE END OF THE
56:24,RUN.
56:25,IT GETS TACKED ON.
56:26,"SO, IF YOU'RE THE SEAHAWKS, DO"
56:28,YOU DARE?
56:29,"I MEAN, YOU HAVE 6 SECONDS."
56:30,I DON'T THINK YOU CAN AFFORD IT.
56:33,"WHAT DO YOU THINK, PARTNER?"
56:34,TO GO FOR IT?
56:35, I THINK YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE
56:37,YOU GET THESE 3 POINTS OUT
56:38,OF HERE.
56:39,"BUT IT'S INTERESTING, AL, THAT"
56:40,YOU'VE GOT -- WE TALKED ABOUT
56:42,THESE RECEIVERS.
56:43,IT HAS BEEN BASICALLY THE
56:45,"BACKUPS, RICARDO LOCKETTE AND"
56:46,"CHRIS MATTHEWS, WHO HAVE MADE"
56:48,THE PLAYS HERE IN THE FIRST
56:50,HALF.
56:50, SO THE FIELD-GOAL UNIT CAME
56:52,OUT.
56:52,NOW THE OFFENSE COMES OUT.
56:54,NOW THEY CALL A TIME-OUT.
56:55,"SO, I MEAN, IF YOU THINK ABOUT"
56:58,IT -- TO RUN A PLAY IN 6
57:01,SECONDS?
57:03,AND THEN YOU RUN THE RISK OF
57:05,NOTHING LEFT ON THE CLOCK.
57:06,AND YOU ARE GOING TO GET THE
57:08,BALL -- SEATTLE WILL -- TO START
57:10,THE SECOND HALF.
57:11," WELL, AND I'LL TELL YOU THIS,"
57:13,AS WELL -- THE PATRIOTS AREN'T A
57:15,BUNCH OF DUMMIES.
57:16,SO YOU'RE OVER THERE WITH 6
57:17,SECONDS.
57:18,THEY KNOW WHAT YOU GOT TO DO.
57:19,YOU EITHER GOT TO THROW A
57:20,SLANT -- YOU GOT TO THROW
57:21,SOMETHING WHERE YOU CATCH IT AND
57:22,THROW IT.
57:23,SO NOW DO YOU WANT TO TAKE A
57:24,CHANCE AGAINST BILL BELICHICK
57:26,"AND MATT PATRICIA'S DEFENSE, OF"
57:28,SORT OF TIPPING YOUR HAND AS TO
57:29,WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO IN THIS
57:31,SITUATION?
57:34,THEY'RE GONNA TRY IT.
57:36, VERY RISKY.
57:37,VERY FASCINATING.
57:39," OBVIOUSLY, YOU CAN'T TAKE A"
57:41,SACK.
57:42,CAN'T SCRAMBLE AROUND.
57:43,IT'S GOT TO BE A CATCH AND
57:44,"THROW, AND I'M GONNA GUESS"
57:46,"RUSSELL WILSON'S BEEN TOLD,"
57:47,"""UNLESS IT IS PERFECT, THROW IT"
57:51,"AWAY."""
57:52, THIS IS LIKE THE NBA --
57:53,CATCH-AND-SHOOT TIME.
57:54,"GET IT, AND GET RID OF IT."
57:59,SO PETE CARROLL GOING AGAINST
58:02,"THE GRAIN, ALL THINGS"
58:04,CONSIDERED.
58:05,6 SECONDS.
58:06,THAT'S THE KEY HERE.
58:08,WILSON.
58:10,LINING UP IN THE SHOTGUN.
58:12,AND NOW NEW ENGLAND IS GOING TO
58:13,TAKE A TIME-OUT.
58:14," SECOND CHARGED TIME-OUT,"
58:15,NEW ENGLAND.
58:17, SO THEY TOOK A LOOK AT THAT
58:19,SET.
58:20,AND NOW WILSON WILL COME OVER
58:22,AND DISCUSS THINGS WITH THE GUYS
58:25,ON THE SIDELINE.
58:26,LITTLE RECAP OF THE GAME.
58:28,JEREMY LANE WITH THAT BIG
58:30,INTERCEPTION TO STYMIE THE
58:32,"DRIVE, BUT THEN HE GOT HURT."
58:34,"CHRIS MATTHEWS, WHO DIDN'T CATCH"
58:36,"A PASS ALL SEASON, A 44-YARD"
58:37,"RECEPTION, SETTING UP A LYNCH"
58:39,SCORE.
58:40,THEN GRONKOWSKI BEATS
58:41,"K.J. WRIGHT, HAULS IT IN FROM"
58:44,BRADY.
58:45,AND WE GET TO 14-7 IN THAT
58:48,MANNER.
58:49," YOU KNOW, IF YOU ARE GOING TO"
58:51,"TAKE A SHOT HERE, YOU WOULD"
58:54,THINK MAYBE CHRIS MATTHEWS.
58:56,"HERE'S A GUY THAT'S 6'5"", 218"
58:58,"POUNDS, RED-ZONE THREAT."
59:01,"THROW IT UP, GIVE HIM A CHANCE"
59:03,GOING AGAINST ONE OF THESE
59:04,SMALLER CORNERS.
59:06, WE'LL SEE.
59:06,YOU GOT LOCKETTE AND KEARSE
59:07,GOING TO THE RIGHT.
59:09, THERE'S MATTHEWS AT THE
59:11,BOTTOM.
59:12, MATTHEWS OUTSIDE.
59:13,BALDWIN IN THE SLOT.
59:14,HE'S GOT TO GET RID OF IT IN A
59:16,HURRY.
59:18,AND HE DOES.
59:19,AND IT'S CAUGHT!
59:21,TOUCHDOWN!
59:22,CHRIS MATTHEWS.
59:24,HOW CRAZY.
59:34,ANOTHER ONE OF THE SEATTLE FREE
59:36,AGENTS.
59:37,YOU DON'T EVEN HEAR ABOUT HIM
59:38,UNTIL HE RECOVERS THE ONSIDE
59:39,KICK AGAINST GREEN BAY.
59:41,"TONIGHT, A 44-YARD RECEPTION,"
59:43,AND HERE A TOUCHDOWN RECEPTION.
59:46,WHAT A GUTSY CALL.
59:48," YEAH, AND YOU GO, OKAY,"
59:49,CHRIS MATTHEWS IS THE FOURTH
59:51,"RECEIVER, AND LOGAN RYAN IS YOUR"
59:53,FOURTH CORNER.
59:55,BUT THE SIZE DIFFERENTIAL ALONE
59:57,AT THAT MOMENT SAID MAYBE
59:58,CHRIS MATTHEWS SHOULD BE THE
60:00,NUMBER-ONE GUY THAT WE COVER
60:02,HERE.
60:03,WHAT A GREAT CALL THERE BY
60:04,PETE CARROLL.
60:10, EXTRA POINT IS GOOD.
60:13,"SO INSTEAD OF IT BEING 14-10,"
60:16,"OR 14-7, EACH TEAM WITH A"
60:19,TOUCHDOWN IN THE FINAL 2:14.
60:24,AND WE'RE KNOTTED AT 14.
60:27, ALL RUSSELL WILSON HAD TIME
60:29,TO DO WAS CATCH IT AND THROW
60:31,IT.
60:32,I'M NOT SO SURE THAT IF HE HAD
60:33,TRIED TO THROW A FADE INTO THE
60:35,BACK OF THE END ZONE THAT THE
60:36,CLOCK WOULDN'T HAVE EXPIRED.
60:39,"INSTEAD, WHAT DO THEY DO?"
60:41,"THEY THROW A BULLET,"
60:42,"BACK-SHOULDER PLAY, AS"
60:43,LOGAN RYAN BACKED INTO THE
60:45,END ZONE.
60:46,"AND TOM BRADY, THE WRY SMILE."
60:51,"WELL, IT IS WHAT WE THOUGHT IT"
60:54,MIGHT BE.
60:55,ONE OF THESE KIND OF GAMES.
60:58,"TWO GREAT COACHES, GUTSY CALLS."
61:01,WOW.
61:02," BOTH OF THESE TEAMS, THEY"
61:03,"HAVE THEIR SUPERSTARS, BUT THEY"
61:05,JUST ADD THESE GUYS.
61:06,THEY COME OUT OF NOWHERE.
61:07,YOU DON'T HEAR VERY MUCH ABOUT
61:09,THEM.
61:09,NEW ENGLAND'S DONE THIS FOR
61:11,"YEARS, AND SEATTLE WITH"
61:12,PETE CARROLL AND THEIR GREAT
61:14,"G.M., JOHN SCHNEIDER, PEOPLE"
61:15,"SAY, ""HOW CAN YOU DRAFT"
61:17,RUSSELL WILSON IN THE THIRD
61:18,"ROUND?"""
61:19,WE KNOW HOW THAT TURNED OUT.
61:20,PICKS UP GUYS LIKE
61:21,CHRIS MATTHEWS.
61:22,WHAT A DIFFERENCE IT MAKES.
61:24," YEAH, AND THEY HAVE SPECIFIC"
61:26,"ROLES, RIGHT?"
61:27,"CHRIS MATTHEWS, ONE OF THOSE"
61:28,"GUYS, A BIG RECEIVER."
61:30,"""I BET YOU HE'D BE GOOD DOWN IN"
61:31,THE RED ZONE.
61:32,LET'S SEE IF HE CAN MAKE A
61:34,"PLAY."""
61:34,LOOK WHAT HAPPENED.
61:43, AND A BOUNCING BALL WILL BE
61:45,FIELDED AT THE 31-YARD LINE.
61:47,AND THAT'S DEVELIN WHO TAKES A
61:50,KNEE.
61:53,AND THAT WILL TAKE US TO
61:55,"HALFTIME, WITH A LOT COMING UP"
61:58,AT THE HALF.
62:00,SEATTLE'S GOING TO GET THE
62:01,SECOND-HALF KICKOFF.
62:04,WHAT A DRIVE THERE.
62:05,"80 YARDS, FIVE PLAYS."
62:07,"THEY RAN IT TWICE, THREW IT"
62:09,THREE TIMES.
62:10,IT TOOK 29 SECONDS FOR THE
62:13,SEAHAWKS.
62:14,ANOTHER LOOK AT THE TOUCHDOWN
62:16,HERE.
62:16," JUST A BULLET THROW, BACK"
62:18,SHOULDER.
62:19,KNEW EXACTLY WHAT HE WANTED TO
62:20,DO WITH IT -- GET IT UP HIGH TO
62:22,"THE 6'5"" CHRIS MATTHEWS."
62:24,NO CHANCE FOR LOGAN RYAN.
62:26," RIGHT, SO LET'S SEE WHAT"
62:28,HAPPENS.
62:28, THERE HE WAS.
62:29,"GREAT FIRST HALF, THOUGH."
62:30, GOSTKOWSKI'S KICKOFF GOES
62:32,THROUGH THE END ZONE.
62:33,SEATTLE WILL TAKE OVER AT THE
62:35,20
62:35,AND WE GO TO MICHELE.
62:36, I JUST SPOKE WITH
62:37,"PETE CARROLL, WHO SAID, AFTER"
62:39,"THE INJURY TO JEREMY LANE, THEY"
62:40,WILL NOT MAKE ADJUSTMENTS IN
62:41,THAT SECONDARY.
62:42,HE'S HAPPY WITH THE PLAYERS
62:43,THEY'VE GOT.
62:44,"HE JUST SAID, ""WE GOT TO GO BEAT"
62:46,THE...OUT OF SOME OTHER PLAYERS
62:47,"AND DO WHAT WE CAME HERE TO DO."""
62:48,"AS FOR BILL BELICHICK, HE SAID,"
62:50,"""THIS GAME IS NO MYSTERY."
62:52,IT'S A PLAYERS' GAME.
62:53,WHICHEVER PLAYERS PLAY BEST IN
62:55,THE SECOND HALF WILL BE
62:56,"CHAMPIONS, AND THAT'S THE WAY IT"
62:58,"SHOULD BE."""
62:59," THANK YOU, MICHELE."
63:01,GREAT CHESS MATCH.
63:03,TWO GUYS WHO HAVE ONLY FACED
63:04,EACH OTHER TWICE BEFORE.
63:05,"BELIEVE IT OR NOT, THESE TWO"
63:06,GUYS FACED EACH OTHER IN 1994.
63:09,"BELICHICK, THE HEAD COACH OF"
63:10,CLEVELAND.
63:11,PETE CARROLL IN HIS ONE YEAR
63:13,WITH THE NEW YORK JETS.
63:16,AND OFF WE GO IN THE SECOND
63:17,HALF.
63:18,STARTING WITH LYNCH.
63:20,THEY'VE DONE A GOOD JOB BOTTLING
63:21,HIM UP TONIGHT.
63:22,HE GOES TO THE 23-YARD LINE.
63:24,HIS 13th CARRY BUT ONLY FOR 48
63:25,YARDS.
63:26,"THE BUZZ -- BRADY, HIS NUMBERS."
63:28,11 CAREER SUPER BOWL T.D.
63:30,"PASSES, INCLUDING TWO IN THE"
63:33,FIRST HALF.
63:34,RUSSELL WILSON.
63:34,TOOK HIM A LONG TIME TO GET
63:36,STARTED.
63:36,DIDN'T HAVE A COMPLETION UNTIL
63:38,THERE WERE ABOUT 5 1/2 MINUTES
63:39,LEFT IN THE HALF.
63:40,THREW THAT T.D. PASS AT THE END.
63:42,CHRIS MATTHEWS DIDN'T MAKE A
63:43,SINGLE CATCH THIS YEAR OR IN HIS
63:45,CAREER.
63:46,FOURTH PLAYER TO MAKE HIS FIRST
63:48,CATCH EVER IN THE SUPER BOWL.
63:50,THIRD SUPER BOWL GAME OF THE 49
63:53,TIED AT THE HALF.
63:56,LYNCH IN THE BACKFIELD.
63:57,GIVE IT TO HIM.
63:58,MARSHAWN LYNCH OFF AND RUNNING.
64:00,HIS BIGGEST CARRY OF THE NIGHT.
64:02,HIS BIGGEST GAIN.
64:04,OUT TO THE 38-YARD LINE FOR A
64:06,FIRST DOWN.
64:06,CARROLL HAPPY ABOUT THAT.
64:08, YOU GOT TO BE CAREFUL.
64:09,YOU'RE TRYING TO STEP UP HERE
64:11,"AND COME AROUND HERE, AND YOU"
64:12,JUST CREATE A LANE.
64:13,IF YOU GET THE FIRST LINEBACKER
64:15,"BLOCKED, WHICH J.R. SWEEZY DOES,"
64:17,NOW YOU GET THAT BIG GUY IN THE
64:19,"SECONDARY, AND LOOK OUT."
64:22,THE PATRIOTS KNEW THAT TO START
64:23,"THIS SECOND HALF, THE SEAHAWKS"
64:25,ARE A TEAM THAT WANT TO COME OUT
64:27,AND POUND THE FOOTBALL.
64:28,SO FAR THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT'S
64:30,HAPPENING.
64:30, AS THEY DID AGAINST
64:31,GREEN BAY.
64:32,NOW THEY RUN PLAY-ACTION.
64:33,WILSON GOING DEEP.
64:35,AND IT'S CAUGHT AGAIN!
64:36,CHRIS MATTHEWS!
64:39,CAN YOU BELIEVE WHAT'S GOING ON?
64:40,THIS IS A GUY WORKING IN A
64:42,FOOT LOCKER STORE WHEN THE
64:43,"SEAHAWKS CALLED HIM, SAID, ""COME"
64:45,"ON AND TRY OUT."""
64:46,"HE HAD TO TELL HIS BOSS, ""LET ME"
64:47,GET OUT OF WORK EARLY.
64:49,"I HAVE TO FLY UP TO SEATTLE."""
64:50, I'LL SAY ONE THING FOR
64:51,CHRIS MATTHEWS -- HE KNOWS HOW
64:53,TO SUBTLY WORK IT.
64:55,A LITTLE NUDGE IN THE BACK RIGHT
64:57,"THERE AGAINST KYLE ARRINGTON,"
64:59,BUT ENOUGH FOR HIM -- JUST A
65:01,LITTLE -- GOT ARRINGTON GOING
65:03,FORWARD.
65:03,AND HIS SIZE IS THE DIFFERENCE.
65:06,LOOK AT THE HEIGHT THAT
65:07,RUSSELL WILSON PUTS ON THAT
65:08,BALL.
65:09,PERFECT.
65:09,WE SAW HIM MAKE SO MANY THROWS
65:11,LIKE THAT IN PRACTICE.
65:12, FROM THE 17.
65:14,NOW IT'S LYNCH.
65:15,TYPICAL LYNCH RIGHT HERE.
65:17,MOVING THE PILE FORWARD.
65:20,TAKING IT TO THE 10-YARD LINE.
65:22," AL, THIS IS WHAT I LOVE"
65:24,ABOUT SEATTLE'S OFFENSIVE LINE.
65:26,THEY LOVE MARSHAWN LYNCH.
65:28,"AND AT THE END OF PLAYS, SO MANY"
65:30,TIMES YOU'LL SEE THE OFFENSIVE
65:32,LINEMEN COME DOWN THE FIELD AND
65:34,SORT OF GET ON HIS BACK AND
65:36,"START TO PUSH HIM, ALMOST LIKE A"
65:38,"RUGBY SCRUM OF SOME KIND, AND"
65:40,JUST PUSH HIM RIGHT DOWN THE
65:42,FIELD.
65:42,"BUT IF THAT GUY GETS GOING,"
65:44,EVERYTHING STARTS TO WORK --
65:45,"THE READ OPTION, THE BOOTLEG"
65:47,"GAME, ALL THAT STARTS TO WORK"
65:48,FOR THIS OFFENSE.
65:49," LYNCH OUT, TURBIN IN."
65:52,BALDWIN IN MOTION.
65:53,FAKE IT TO HIM.
65:55,GIVE IT TO TURBIN.
65:56,AND HE'LL GET WRESTLED DOWN A
65:58,YARD SHORT OF THE FIRST DOWN.
65:59,SPOT THE BALL AT THE 8-YARD
66:02,LINE.
66:03,THIRD AND 1.
66:04, I'LL TELL YOU WHO'S HAVING A
66:05,REALLY NICE GAME SO FAR IS
66:07,J.R. SWEEZY.
66:07,WE HAVE SEEN HIM RIGHT ON SOME
66:09,BIG BLOCKS.
66:10,HE'S HAD TO TAKE ON
66:12,VINCE WILFORK MOST OF THE NIGHT.
66:14,A VERY SOLID RUN BLOCKER ALL
66:16,SEASON LONG.
66:17,AND THIS FORMER DEFENSIVE
66:19,LINEMAN IS COMING OUT HERE A
66:20,LITTLE ANGRY TO START THIS
66:22,SECOND HALF.
66:28, GOT A STACK AT THE BOTTOM OF
66:29,"THE SCREEN, INCLUDING MATTHEWS"
66:31,THERE.
66:33,YOU GOT LYNCH BACK IN THE GAME.
66:35,IT'S THIRD DOWN AND 1.
66:38,AND LYNCH IS GONNA GET STOPPED.
66:40,AND THAT IS ROB NINKOVICH.
66:41,HE COULDN'T GET BY NINKOVICH
66:43,THERE.
66:44,AND THAT'S GONNA SET UP FOURTH
66:45,"DOWN, AND HERE COMES THE"
66:46,FIELD-GOAL GROUP.
66:48, RIGHT OFF THE EDGE.
66:50,NOBODY BLOCKED HIM.
66:51,"COME RIGHT DOWN THE LINE HERE,"
66:53,AND THAT'S JUST A VETERAN
66:54,PLAYER UNDERSTANDING THE
66:55,SITUATION.
66:56,GONNA GIVE THE BALL TO
66:57,"MARSHAWN LYNCH, AND HE JUST"
66:58,BEATS THEM TO THE PUNCH.
67:03, THAT SETS UP A 27-YARD
67:06,FIELD-GOAL ATTEMPT FOR
67:08,STEVEN HAUSCHKA.
67:10,2 FOR 2 AT THE MEADOWLANDS LAST
67:12,YEAR.
67:15,AND THAT GIVES THE
67:17,SEATTLE SEAHAWKS THEIR FIRST
67:20,LEAD OF THE NIGHT.
67:22,BEAUTIFUL TONIGHT.
67:23,ROOF OPEN.
67:25,GOOD GAME.
67:26,17-14.
67:28,BELICHICK WORKING WITH HIS
67:30,"DEFENSE ON THE SIDELINE, AND"
67:32,TOM BRADY READY TO GET THE BALL
67:34,FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE SECOND
67:36,HALF.
67:39, THINK YOU ONLY HAVE TO SAY
67:40,"ONE THING -- ""SOMEBODY GO COVER"
67:41,"CHRIS MATTHEWS."""
67:43, AMAZING.
67:46,HAUSCHKA'S KICK.
67:49,RESULTS IN A TOUCHBACK.
67:52,DOESN'T GET MUCH BETTER.
67:53,BILL BELICHICK TOOK OVER IN
67:54,2000
67:56,BRADY TOOK OVER AS THE STARTER
67:59,IN '01.
67:59,"MOST NFL TITLE GAMES,"
68:01,HEAD COACH/QUARTERBACK DUO --
68:03,GO BACK TO OTTO GRAHAM AND
68:05,PAUL BROWN.
68:06,"VINCE LOMBARDI, OF COURSE,"
68:07,AND BART STARR -- FOUR NFL
68:09,CHAMPIONSHIP GAMES AND
68:10,SUPER BOWLS I AND II.
68:12,AND BRADY AND BELICHICK.
68:14,PLAYING IN THEIR SIXTH
68:16,SUPER BOWL.
68:18,ALL OF THEM HAVE BEEN VERY
68:20,CLOSE.
68:21,THE PREVIOUS FIVE HAVE BEEN
68:23,DETERMINED BY 4 POINTS OR
68:25,FEWER.
68:26,RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A 3-POINT
68:27,GAME.
68:29,EARLY THIRD QUARTER.
68:33,BRADY.
68:34,QUICKLY TO THE OUTSIDE.
68:35,AND TAKEN DOWN IS EDELMAN AFTER
68:37,A GAIN OF A COUPLE.
68:38,KAM CHANCELLOR RIGHT THERE.
68:40,SECOND DOWN AND 8.
68:44, HERE WE GO.
68:45,KAM CHANCELLOR RIGHT OVER
68:47,"HERE, WHO HAS BEEN SORT OF THE"
68:49,"UNDERNEATH COVERAGE GUY, AND"
68:51,THEY'RE TRYING TO JUST ISOLATE
68:53,THOSE BIG GUYS.
68:54,EDELMAN HAS BEEN THE QUICKNESS.
68:59,SHANE VEREEN HAS BEEN THE
69:01,QUICKNESS.
69:02,AND SO FAR EVERYTHING'S GOING
69:04,"FINE, AND YET THEY LOOK AT THE"
69:06,"SCOREBOARD AND IT'S 17-14,"
69:07,SEATTLE.
69:09, THAT'S GRONKOWSKI.
69:11,SETS UP ON THE LEFT SIDE.
69:13,PROVIDING LEVERAGE HERE.
69:14,BLOUNT.
69:15,CAN BARELY GET OUT OF THE
69:16,BACKFIELD.
69:17,McDANIEL IS THERE TO STOP HIM.
69:20,IT'LL BE THIRD DOWN AND 6
69:22,FOR NEW ENGLAND.
69:24," YEAH, AND NOW COMES THE"
69:26,SITUATION.
69:26,IT'S BIG IF YOU CAN GET THEM
69:28,BACK THIRD AND 6 AND KEEP THEM
69:30,OUT OF THOSE THIRD AND 2s AND
69:32,"3s, BECAUSE NOW YOUR PASS RUSH"
69:33,HAS A CHANCE.
69:34,"BUT SO FAR, IT HAS BEEN"
69:36,TOM BRADY'S ABILITY TO GET RID
69:38,OF THE FOOTBALL BEFORE THAT PASS
69:40,RUSH CAN GET THERE THAT HAS
69:42,ALLOWED THEM TO MOVE THE BALL UP
69:44,AND DOWN THE FIELD.
69:46, THREE RECEIVERS SET TO THE
69:48,RIGHT SIDE AND ONE -- LaFELL --
69:51,UP ON THE LEFT SIDE ON THIRD AND
69:53,6
69:56,SHOWING BLITZ.
69:57,HERE THEY COME.
69:58,BRADY GETS KNOCKED DOWN BUT GETS
70:00,THE PASS AWAY.
70:00,AND GRONKOWSKI HAS THE FIRST
70:02,DOWN.
70:03,SO BRADY GETS TAKEN TO THE
70:05,GRASS BUT GETS IT AWAY AND
70:07,CONVERTS.
70:08, IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.
70:09,MICHAEL BENNETT COULD NOT HAVE
70:11,GOTTEN TO TOM BRADY ANY FASTER
70:12,THAN THIS.
70:13,"RIGHT AROUND, RIGHT IN ON HIM."
70:16,AND HE STILL DOESN'T GET THE
70:17,PRESSURE THAT HE NEEDS.
70:19,GRONKOWSKI ON THE OUTSIDE.
70:20,WE'VE SEEN IT ALREADY.
70:21,IF THEY'RE GOING TO PLAY MAN
70:23,"COVERAGE, SEATTLE'S GOING TO"
70:25,LOSE THOSE BATTLES --
70:26,"KAM CHANCELLOR, K.J. WRIGHT."
70:28,THIS GUY IS JUST TOO GOOD.
70:31,UNANIMOUS ALL-PRO.
70:32, ANOTHER SET HERE WITH THE
70:34,GUY LINED UP ON THE END AT THE
70:36,RIGHT -- CAMERON FLEMING IS
70:39,ELIGIBLE.
70:40,"THEY RUN IN THAT DIRECTION,"
70:41,"WITH THE UNBALANCED LINE,"
70:43,AND BLOUNT PICKS UP A YARD.
70:45,CHANCELLOR COMING UP TO STUFF
70:47,HIM.
70:47,SECOND DOWN.
70:48," AL, DON'T YOU GET THE FEELING"
70:50,THAT THE PATRIOTS HAVE TO BE A
70:51,LITTLE DISAPPOINTED?
70:52,I THINK THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE
70:53,GOING TO HAVE A BETTER DAY
70:54,RUNNING THE FOOTBALL.
70:55,THEY'VE BEEN BRINGING THAT EXTRA
70:57,"OFFENSIVE LINEMAN/TIGHT END IN,"
70:59,"IN CAMERON FLEMING, AND THEY"
71:01,JUST HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO
71:03,ESTABLISH IT.
71:04,SO IT'S ALL TOM BRADY.
71:05, DEFINITELY.
71:06,HAD THAT ONE DRIVE STYMIED ON
71:07,"THE INTERCEPTION, AND THEN TO"
71:09,GET BEAT BY A GUY NAMED
71:10,"CHRIS MATTHEWS, WHO'S NOT CAUGHT"
71:11,A PASS?
71:12,AND THEN TO GIVE UP THE
71:14,"5-PLAY, 29-YARD -- OR 29-SECOND"
71:16,DRIVE AT THE END OF THE FIRST
71:19,HALF.
71:20,BRANDON BOLDEN IS NOW THE
71:21,RUNNING BACK.
71:22,HAVEN'T SEEN HIM.
71:23,FAKE TO HIM.
71:24,AND THEN THE PASS IS INCOMPLETE.
71:26,BRADY TOSSING IT OVER THE
71:27,"MIDDLE, PRESSURE PUT ON BY"
71:29,BENNETT.
71:29,WAS ANYBODY IN THE AREA?
71:33, HE WAS DEFINITELY UNDER
71:34,PRESSURE AGAIN.
71:37,MICHAEL BENNETT.
71:41,HERE WE GO.
71:41,RIGHT DOWN INSIDE.
71:42,AND HE'S GOING TO GET THERE
71:44,AGAIN.
71:44, COULD THIS BE GROUNDING?
71:45,LOOK AT THIS HERE.
71:46,"OKAY, PRESSURE."
71:48,WHO IS HE THROWING IT TO?
71:49," WELL, I..."
71:52,THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.
71:53,[ LAUGHS ]
71:53, HELLO?
71:58,THIRD DOWN AND 9.
72:04,PLAY CLOCK AT :01.
72:08,BRADY.
72:08,OVER THE MIDDLE.
72:09,AND IT'S PICKED OFF AT THE
72:11,42-YARD LINE BY BOBBY WAGNER!
72:15,SECOND INTERCEPTION.
72:17,"BOBBY WAGNER, OVER THE MIDDLE."
72:18,THERE'S A FLAG ON THE PLAY.
72:20,THE FLAG IS UP TO THE 41-YARD
72:22,LINE.
72:23,AVRIL IS DOWN.
72:24,"LANE HAD THE EARLY INTERCEPTION,"
72:26,AND HE GOT HURT AND IS OUT FOR
72:27,THE GAME.
72:28,YOU'VE GOT AVRIL DOWN.
72:29,YOU GOT A PENALTY FLAG
72:31,DOWNFIELD.
72:31,AND VINOVICH WILL LET US KNOW.
72:33,"IN THE MEANTIME, BRADY'S"
72:34,ALREADY WALKING OFF THE FIELD.
72:38, HERE WE GO.
72:38,WATCH WAGNER.
72:39,"AS THIS COMES ACROSS, HE GOES"
72:40,THAT WAY AND COMES BACK.
72:45,BRADY THOUGHT THAT HE HAD
72:46,CLEARED WAGNER WHEN GRONKOWSKI
72:48,SETTLED DOWN.
72:49,"WAGNER, ATHLETIC ENOUGH TO JUMP"
72:51,BACK UNDERNEATH IT FOR THE HUGE
72:53,PLAY.
72:56, AND THE PENALTY IS AFTER --
72:58," AFTER THE INTERCEPTION,"
73:00,"DURING THE RETURN, ILLEGAL"
73:02,BLOCK IN THE BACK.
73:04,"INTERCEPTING TEAM, NUMBER 25."
73:06,10-YARD PENALTY FROM THE SPOT
73:07,OF THE FOUL.
73:08,SEATTLE KEEPS THE BALL.
73:10,FIRST DOWN.
73:11, AFTER THE PICK.
73:12,THE PENALTY IS ON
73:13,RICHARD SHERMAN FOR THE ILLEGAL
73:15,BLOCK IN THE BACK.
73:21,SO THAT MOVES THE BALL BACK TO
73:23,THE MIDFIELD STRIPE.
73:24,RIGHT ON THE 50-YARD LINE.
73:26,WITH 8:07 LEFT IN THE THIRD.
73:29,AND THERE'S SHERMAN AND WAGNER.
73:31," YOU KNOW WHAT, AL?"
73:32,"SOMETIMES, EVEN THOUGH YOU DON'T"
73:34,"GET THE SACKS, IF YOU GET THE"
73:36,"HITS, IT ACCELERATES THE PROCESS"
73:38,IN THE QUARTERBACK'S MIND.
73:40,AND I THINK THAT THEY HURRIED
73:42,THE CLOCK OF TOM BRADY ON THAT
73:43,THROW.
73:46,"BOBBY WAGNER, WHAT A DIFFERENCE"
73:47,"WHEN HE CAME BACK IN THE LINEUP,"
73:49,RIGHT?
73:49,UNDER 10 POINTS A GAME.
73:52, MISSED FIVE GAMES -- TURF
73:54,TOE.
73:54,"PICKED IN THAT SAME DRAFT, JUST"
73:56,AHEAD OF RUSSELL WILSON IN 2012.
74:01,NOW WILSON SLINGS ONE TO THE
74:03,LEFT SIDE.
74:03,MATTHEWS AGAIN.
74:06,THIS IS JUST AMAZING.
74:07,41-YARD LINE.
74:08,HE PLAYED IN THE CFL FOR TWO
74:09,YEARS.
74:10,WAS THE ROOKIE OF THE YEAR IN
74:11,THE CANADIAN FOOTBALL LEAGUE
74:13,BACK IN 2012.
74:14, BRANDON BROWNER IS ONE OF
74:16,"THE BIGGEST, BADDEST CORNERS"
74:17,I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE.
74:18,AND MATTHEWS THAT TIME JUST
74:20,THREW HIM OFF.
74:21,"I MEAN, THESE ARE TWO HUGE MEN"
74:23,GOING AT IT ON THE OUTSIDE.
74:25,I THINK THEY MAKE THE SWITCH
74:27,BECAUSE BROWNER HAS MORE SIZE.
74:29,HE CAN JUMP UP AND HANDLE THOSE
74:31,JUMP BALLS.
74:32,BUT NOW CAN HE HANDLE HIS
74:33,QUICKNESS?
74:35, SECOND AND 1 FROM THE 41.
74:42,AND LYNCH...
74:44,TO MOVE THE STICKS.
74:45,"YOU KNOW, YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT"
74:47,CHRIS MATTHEWS.
74:49,"DARRELL BEVELL, THE OFFENSIVE"
74:51,COORDINATOR NICKNAMED HIM
74:52,"""HARDBALL"" FOR CHRIS MATTHEWS"
74:54,"OF MSNBC, WHO IS HERE AT THE"
74:56,GAME TODAY.
74:57,AND THIS CHRIS MATTHEWS -- THE
74:59,SEAHAWKS' CHRIS MATTHEWS --
75:00,"SAID, ""I CAN'T BELIEVE IT."
75:01,"EVERY TIME I WIKIPEDIA MYSELF,"
75:03,IT KEEPS COMING UP THE OTHER
75:04,"GUY."""
75:05,TOMORROW HE MAY SUPPLANT
75:07,MSNBC's CHRIS MATTHEWS IN THE
75:10,NUMBER-ONE SPOT.
75:11, JUST JUMP RIGHT OVER.
75:12,HE MAY BE THERE RIGHT NOW.
75:14,I WOULD SAY HE'S TRENDING.
75:15,YOU AND I ARE SO HIP.
75:16,BUT I WOULD SAY HE'S TRENDING
75:17,RIGHT NOW.
75:18, NO QUESTION.
75:22,FROM THE 38-YARD LINE.
75:24,OFF THE PISTOL FORMATION.
75:27,WILSON HAS TIME.
75:29,LOOK HOW ELUSIVE HE IS.
75:30,"THERE'S A FLAG DOWN, HOWEVER."
75:31,THERE IT IS.
75:32,YOU SAW IT AT THE 31-YARD LINE.
75:33,AND WILSON WILL SLIDE TO A STOP
75:35,"AT THE 21, AND WE'LL GET THE"
75:36,CALL FROM VINOVICH.
75:39, YOU CANNOT GET A HAND ON
75:41,RUSSELL WILSON.
75:45, HOLDING.
75:47,"DEFENSE, NUMBER 39."
75:49,5-YARD PENALTY FROM THE END
75:50,OF THE RUN.
75:51,AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN.
75:52, THAT'S BRANDON BROWNER.
75:54,"THAT'S NOTHING NEW, BECAUSE HE"
75:56,DRAWS A TON OF PENALTIES.
75:58, THIS IS HILARIOUS.
75:59,CHANDLER JONES -- LOOK AT THIS.
76:01,"DEAD TO RIGHTS, RIGHT?"
76:02,CAN'T EVEN GET A FINGER ON
76:05,RUSSELL WILSON.
76:06,WILSON SAW IT COMING THE WHOLE
76:07,TIME.
76:08,HE JUST VERY CASUALLY LOOKED
76:09,"LIKE HE WAS LOOKING DOWNFIELD,"
76:11,BUT SAW HIM OUT OF THE CORNER OF
76:12,HIS EYE.
76:13,"THEN THAT LITTLE MOVE OF HIS,"
76:14,AND TAKES OFF.
76:16,THIS GUY IS SOMETHING SPECIAL.
76:21," BROWNER, 39."
76:22,THERE'S THE PENALTY.
76:24,HOLDING ON TO KEARSE.
76:27,AND SHOVING HIM.
76:28,SETTING UP A FIRST DOWN AT THE
76:29,18-YARD LINE.
76:34,LYNCH.
76:35,STILL GOING.
76:37,TO THE 4.
76:40,HE'S JUST A RUNAWAY TRUCK.
76:43,TACKLED BY NINKOVICH.
76:47, WATCH THE MOVE IN THE MIDDLE
76:49,OF THE HOLE.
76:49,RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS
76:51,RUN -- I THINK THAT'S
76:52,JAMIE COLLINS THAT CAME DOWN
76:54,"THERE -- HE IS -- AL, YOU"
76:56,DESCRIBED HIM EARLIER AS A
76:58,SPLIT-FOOTED RUNNER.
77:00,HE RUNS WITH HIS FEET SO FAR
77:02,"APART, IT ALLOWS HIM TO MAKE"
77:04,"THESE LATERAL CUTS, AND"
77:05,PEOPLE -- REALLY GOOD
77:07,TACKLERS -- CAN'T GET THEIR ARMS
77:09,WRAPPED AROUND HIM.
77:10, TUKUAFU'S THE FULLBACK.
77:15,FROM THE 4.
77:16,GIVE IT TO MARSHAWN.
77:19,TO THE 3-YARD LINE HE GOES.
77:20,GAIN OF 1.
77:21,SECOND AND GOAL.
77:23,THE HAWKS' LAST FOUR DRIVES HAVE
77:24,"BEEN TOUCHDOWN, FIELD GOAL,"
77:26,"TOUCHDOWN, AND IN PROGRESS RIGHT"
77:29,HERE.
77:32, HERE'S WHERE YOU REALLY --
77:33,"FOR TOM BRADY, YOU KIND OF GOT"
77:35,"TO JUST KEEP IT TOGETHER, RIGHT?"
77:37,"OKAY, YOU MADE A BIG MISTAKE TO"
77:39,"START THE FIRST HALF, YOU MAKE A"
77:42,BIG MISTAKE HERE IN THE SECOND
77:43,HALF.
77:44,BUT THESE TWO TEAMS HAVE PLAYED
77:46,FROM BEHIND DURING THE ENTIRETY
77:48,OF THESE PLAYOFFS.
77:49,NO BIG DEAL.
77:52, SECOND AND GOAL.
77:56,PLAY FAKE.
77:57,LITTLE LOB.
77:59,WIDE OPEN!
78:00,"TOUCHDOWN, DOUG BALDWIN!"
78:11,"AFTER THE WAGNER INTERCEPTION,"
78:14,"SIX PLAYS, 50 YARDS."
78:15,FLAG WENT DOWN.
78:16,THERE WILL BE A CELEBRATION
78:18,"PENALTY, WHICH WILL BE ASSESSED"
78:20,ON THE KICKOFF.
78:28, PLAY-ACTION TO GET THE RUN
78:30,GAME GOING.
78:30,BUT LET'S GIVE CREDIT TO
78:32,DOUG BALDWIN.
78:33,A VETERAN PLAYER.
78:34," AFTER THE TOUCHDOWN,"
78:36,UNSPORTSMANLIKE CONDUCT.
78:37,"OFFENSE, NUMBER 89."
78:40,15-YARD PENALTY ON THE KICKOFF.
78:42,TOUCHDOWN IS GOOD.
78:44, VETERAN RECEIVER KNOWS HOW
78:46,TO USE THE UMPIRE IN THE MIDDLE
78:48,OF THE FIELD TO PICK OFF THE
78:50,MAN COVERAGE.
78:51,HE DID IT PERFECTLY.
78:53,BRILLIANT PLAY BY DOUG BALDWIN.
78:54, DOUG BALDWIN.
78:55,HIS FIRST CATCH.
78:56,PLAYED AT STANFORD.
78:57,THERE'S A GUY WHO HIT THE MOTHER
78:59,LODE.
78:59,HOW ABOUT CATCHING PASSES FROM
79:01,ANDREW LUCK IN COLLEGE AND
79:02,RUSSELL WILSON AS A PRO?
79:05,HAUSCHKA FOR THE EXTRA POINT.
79:09,CASH IN -- TOUCHDOWN AFTER THE
79:12,TURNOVER.
79:14," WE SAW RICHARD SHERMAN GOING,"
79:16,"""24, 24."""
79:18,HERE'S WHAT HE WAS SAYING.
79:20,WHO IS THE BEST CORNERBACK IN
79:22,ALL OF FOOTBALL?
79:24,"WELL, PART OF THE DEBATE,"
79:25,"DARRELLE REVIS, 24, JUST GOT"
79:29,BEAT.
79:30,"""24."
79:32,"THAT MAKES ME NUMBER ONE."""
79:35,[ LAUGHS ]
79:37," YOU KNOW, HE'S BETTER THAN"
79:39,HALF THE LOUNGE ACTS IN VEGAS.
79:40,HE'S TAKEN INTERVIEW SESSIONS TO
79:42,PERFORMANCE ART.
79:45,WHAT A CHARACTER.
79:48,"AND ONE HECK OF A PLAYER, BY THE"
79:49,WAY.
79:50,"AFTER THE PENALTY, THE KICKOFF"
79:52,FROM 15 YARDS FARTHER BACK.
79:53,AND DANNY AMENDOLA RUNS IT BACK

80:04,AND FORMER TEAM -- GO BACK TO

80:13,YOU GO BACK TO 2002 --
80:15,JON GRUDEN HAD LEFT OAKLAND FOR
80:17,"SOME DRAFT CHOICES,"
80:19,"BILL CALLAHAN TOOK OVER, AND"
80:20,GRUDEN WON A SUPER BOWL WITH THE

80:25,THAT POINT.
80:26, AND PETE CARROLL ONE OF THE
80:28,MOST COMPETITIVE GUYS IN ALL OF

80:49,FLAG IS DOWN.
80:50,COULD BE A HOLD.
80:52,AT THE 48-YARD LINE.

80:56,RIGHT NOW.
80:56, HOLDING.
80:57,"OFFENSE, NUMBER 66."
80:58, COMING BACK.
80:58, 10-YARD PENALTY.
81:00,REPEAT FIRST DOWN.
81:01, BRYAN STORK.
81:02,THAT'S THE CENTER.
81:07, RIGHT HERE.
81:08,YOU CAN'T BLOCK THIS GUY.
81:09,MICHAEL BENNETT IS SIMPLY TAKING
81:11,OVER THE FOOTBALL GAME.

81:15,"VOTED THE RIMINGTON AWARD, BEST"

81:25,"OTHER DAY, FIRED BY THE JETS,"
81:26,FIRED BY THE PATRIOTS.
81:28,SOMETIMES IT'S A LITTLE DICEY
81:29,"BRINGING IT UP, BUT HE SAID, ""MY"

81:33,[ BOTH LAUGH ]

81:38,LINE.
81:43,BRADY GOING DEEP DOWN THE LEFT
81:45,SIDELINE.
81:46,AND THROWS THAT ONE ON THE
81:47,CHALK.
81:48,INTENDED FOR LaFELL.
81:49,WE GO TO MICHELE.
81:50, SEATTLE STARTING DEFENSIVE
81:52,END CLIFF AVRIL TOOK A HEAVY
81:53,HIT.
81:54,HE HAS GONE TO THE LOCKER ROOM
81:56,FOR A CONCUSSION EVALUATION.
81:57,QUESTIONABLE WITH A HEAD INJURY.
81:59,HE WAS ESCORTED OFF THE FIELD
82:00,AND TO THE LOCKER ROOM BY THE
82:02,TEAM INTERNIST AS WELL AS THE
82:04,LEAGUE'S UNAFFILIATED

82:19,PLAYED HERE WITH THE
82:20,CARDINALS A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO.
82:22,SECOND DOWN AND 20.
82:28,AND BRADY WILL DUMP IT OFF
82:29,UNDERNEATH.
82:30,EDELMAN LOOKING FOR ROOM.
82:33,PICKS UP ABOUT 6 EXTRA YARDS
82:34,AFTER HE WAS INITIALLY STOPPED.
82:36,GETS THE BALL OUT TO THE 36-YARD
82:38,LINE.
82:39,IT WILL BE THIRD DOWN AND 9
82:40,FOR THE PATS.
82:47," WELL, HERE WE GO."
82:48,DOWN THE FIELD.
82:49,BRANDON LaFELL AND
82:52,RICHARD SHERMAN.
82:53,OBVIOUSLY LaFELL NOT EVEN REALLY
82:56,LOOKING FOR A PASS.
82:57,THAT'S ONE OF THOSE UNDERPLAYS
82:59,WHERE HE KNOWS ALL ALONG HIS
83:01,JOB IS TO BLOCK.
83:04, KEY THIRD AND 9.
83:08,AMENDOLA COMES THIS WAY AND THAT
83:10,WAY.
83:12,AND BRADY WILL FIRE.
83:14,AND IT IS AMENDOLA WHO CAN'T
83:16,MAKE THE CATCH.
83:18,AMENDOLA WITH WAGNER RIGHT
83:21,THERE.
83:23,"AND FOURTH AND 9, AND IN COMES"
83:25,THE PUNTING GROUP.
83:28, AMENDOLA RIGHT HERE.
83:30,AND THEN I THINK HE GETS A
83:32,GLANCE AT BOBBY WAGNER COMING
83:34,RIGHT FOR HIS CHIN STRAP.
83:36,BUT THAT'S A MISS BY BRADY.
83:38,JUST HAD A CHANCE THERE.
83:39,LOOKED LIKE IT HIT HIM PRETTY
83:41,"GOOD, BUT MAYBE A LITTLE FLINCH."
83:44, WE HAVE WAGNER ALREADY WITH
83:45,11 TACKLES AND AN INTERCEPTION.
83:47,AND THE PUNT...
83:49,CANNOT BE SAVED.
83:51, STRATEGY PRETTY CLEAR FOR THE
83:53,PATRIOTS ON DEFENSE.
83:54,WHAT THEY WANTED TO DO IS PLAY
83:55,THE FOUR BIG DEFENSIVE LINEMEN
83:57,"UP FRONT, PUT JAMIE COLLINS IN"
83:59,THE MIDDLE OF THE DEFENSE AND
84:00,LET HIM RUN SIDELINE TO
84:02,SIDELINE AND MAKE PLAYS.
84:03,HE'S MADE SOME PRETTY NICE PLAYS
84:05,"INSIDE, TRACKING DOWN"
84:06,MARSHAWN LYNCH.
84:08,BUT IT WAS THE PLAY RIGHT BEFORE
84:10,THE HALF THAT REALLY MADE THE
84:12,DIFFERENCE.
84:12,HE DID NOT GET THE PROPER
84:16,LEVERAGE ON RUSSELL WILSON.
84:18,WILSON'S QUICKNESS HAS BEEN A
84:20,FACTOR ALL NIGHT.
84:21,AND THAT ONE RIGHT THERE SET UP
84:23,THAT TOUCHDOWN RIGHT BEFORE THE
84:24,HALF.
84:25,"BIG, BIG, BIG MISTAKE."
84:28, LYNCH HAS CARRIED FOR 88
84:29,YARDS.
84:30,"WILSON ONLY 3 CARRIES, BUT FOR"
84:31,39
84:33,LOOK AT THE TIME HE HAS.
84:35,AND THEN CAUGHT UP AT THE
84:37,45-YARD LINE.
84:38,RICARDO LOCKETTE MAKING THE
84:40,GRAB.
84:43,THAT'S A GAIN OF 25 YARDS.
84:46, RICARDO LOCKETTE KIND OF
84:48,MAKES ME LAUGH.
84:49,THEY GO THE BOOTLEG PLAY OUT OF
84:50,HERE.
84:51,AND WATCH RUSSELL WILSON.
84:52,THEY SAY HE DOESN'T READ
84:53,DEFENSES?
84:54,MY FOOT.
84:55,HE MUST HAVE LOOKED AT FOUR
84:56,DIFFERENT RECEIVERS ON THAT PLAY
84:58,UNTIL HE FINALLY COMES ALL THE
84:59,WAY ACROSS BACK TO THE BACK
85:01,SIDE.
85:01,RUSSELL WILSON IS GETTING VERY
85:03,COMFORTABLE.
85:04,THREE TOUCHDOWNS AND A FIELD
85:06,"GOAL, THE LAST FOUR DRIVES."
85:07," AFTER NO YARDS, NO"
85:09,COMPLETIONS IN THE FIRST QUARTER
85:12,AND MOST OF THE SECOND PERIOD.
85:14,LYNCH.
85:16,2 TOUGH YARDS.
85:17,2 1/2 MINUTES REMAINING IN THE
85:21,THIRD.
85:22, YOU WATCH A PLAYER LIKE
85:24,CHANDLER JONES HAVE A FREE SHOT
85:26,LIKE HE HAD ON THAT PLAY AGAINST
85:28,"MARSHAWN LYNCH, AND HE BARELY"
85:30,SLOWED HIM DOWN.
85:31,YOU KNOW?
85:32,AND AS YOU GET INTO THE SECOND
85:34,"HALF, DEFENSES AND DEFENDERS,"
85:36,"ESPECIALLY THE BIG GUYS, GET"
85:39,TIRED.
85:39,"AND MARSHAWN LYNCH, IF YOU'RE"
85:41,TIRED -- HE'S HARD ENOUGH WHEN
85:42,YOU'RE FRESH.
85:43,"YOU'RE TIRED, IT GETS REALLY"
85:45,DIFFICULT.
85:46, A LOT OF SPECULATION AS TO
85:47,"WHETHER THEY'LL KEEP HIM,"
85:48,WHETHER THEY CAN AFFORD HIM.
85:49,THERE'S SOME SPECULATION THAT
85:51,THEY'RE READY TO MAKE A BIG
85:52,LONG-TERM DEAL WITH HIM
85:54,GOING FORWARD.
85:55,CATCH MADE ON THE OUTSIDE.
85:57,THAT'S JERMAINE KEARSE.
85:59,MALCOLM BUTLER MAKES THE TACKLE.
86:01,"KEARSE, THE BIG HERO AT THE END"
86:02,OF THE GAME AGAINST GREEN BAY
86:04,WITH THE OVERTIME CATCH.
86:05,"HIS ONLY CATCH OF THAT GAME,"
86:07,AFTER HE'D BEEN TARGETED SIX
86:09,TIMES.
86:09,ALL FOUR WILSON INTERCEPTIONS
86:12,WERE ON PASSES INTENDED FOR HIM.
86:13,THE OTHER ONE WAS INCOMPLETE.
86:15, HOW ABOUT A GUY THAT HAD THE
86:16,GAME-WINNING TOUCHDOWN IN
86:18,BACK-TO-BACK CHAMPIONSHIP
86:19,GAMES?
86:20, AMAZING.
86:20, RIGHT?
86:21,NFC CHAMPIONSHIP GAMES AGAINST
86:22,SAN FRANCISCO ON THAT
86:23,FOURTH-DOWN PLAY THE YEAR
86:24,BEFORE.
86:25,COMES RIGHT BACK WITH ANOTHER
86:26,ONE.
86:27, AND HOW ABOUT A QUARTERBACK
86:28,WHO KEEPS GOING TO A GUY WHO
86:30,KEEPS GETTING INTERCEPTED EVERY
86:31,TIME HE'S TARGETED?
86:33,THIRD AND 3.
86:36,WILSON SURVEYS.
86:38,AND IT IS BOBBLED AND DROPPED.
86:42,THAT TIME IT'S KEARSE AGAIN.
86:44,"MALCOLM BUTLER, ONE OF THE EXTRA"
86:46,"DEFENSIVE BACKS, COMES IN TO"
86:47,HELP BREAK IT UP.
86:48,IT'LL BE FOURTH DOWN AND 3.
86:50, GONNA GO HERE AND BACK

86:52,"JUST A LITTLE RUB ROUTE, AND"
86:54,THEY GOT IT.
86:54,"THEY HAD THE ROOKIE,"
86:56,MALCOLM BUTLER.
86:57,AND THAT TIME KEARSE JUST COULD
86:59,NOT HOLD ON TO IT.
87:00,HUGE PLAY.
87:02,"THAT IS IN SCORING POSITION, OR"
87:04,YOUR PUNTER COMES ON THE FIELD.
87:07,AND HERE COMES JON RYAN.
87:10, JULIAN EDELMAN SETS UP
87:12,INSIDE HIS OWN 10-YARD LINE.
87:15,"OOH, LOW SNAP."
87:17,PICKS IT UP AND GETS IT AWAY.
87:20,EDELMAN SAYS STAY AWAY FROM IT.
87:23,AND IT BOUNDS OUT OF BOUNDS AT
87:24,THE 11-YARD LINE.
87:28,24-14.
87:30,"YOU KNOW, YOU LOOK AT THE PATH"
87:32,THAT EACH OF THESE TEAMS TOOK.
87:33,2-2 WAS NEW ENGLAND GOING INTO
87:35,WEEK 5.
87:35,THEY LOST IN KANSAS CITY ON THAT
87:37,MONDAY NIGHT.
87:38,THE SKY'S FALLING.
87:39,"SEATTLE WAS 3-3, THEN THEY WERE"
87:40,6-4.

87:42,TO TURN THINGS AROUND.
87:44, YEAH.
87:44,AND GO FIGURE.
87:46,HERE'S A TEAM DOWN 16-0 AGAINST
87:48,"THE GREEN BAY PACKERS, BUT THEIR"
87:50,DEFENSE HUNG IN THERE SO WELL --
87:52,ALL THOSE TURNOVERS IN THE FIRST
87:54,HALF -- TO GIVE THEM A CHANCE TO
87:55,GET TO THIS GAME.

87:59,"AND RUSSELL WILSON,"
88:00,"MARSHAWN LYNCH, PUTTING ON A"
88:02,"SHOW, AS WELL."
88:02, AND NEW ENGLAND KNOWS WHAT
88:04,IT'S LIKE TO COME FROM BEHIND.
88:05,THEY WERE DOWN TWICE BY 14 IN
88:07,THE DIVISIONAL ROUND TO THE
88:08,RAVENS.
88:09,THEY START THIS DRIVE WITH
88:10,VEREEN TAKING THE BALL UP
88:12,TO THE 17-YARD LINE FOR A SHORT
88:14,GAIN.
88:14,CHANCELLOR MAKES THE TACKLE.
88:16,THAT KNEE SEEMS TO BE FINE.
88:17,PLAYING WITH THE BRACE TODAY.
88:19," INTERESTING HERE, AL, THAT"
88:20,NOW WE'RE GETTING SHANE VEREEN
88:22,IN THE BACKFIELD.
88:23,THEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO POUND IT
88:25,"IN THERE WITH LeGARRETTE BLOUNT,"
88:26,AND -- HERE HE COMES BACK IN THE
88:28,"GAME NOW, BUT YOU WONDER NOW, AS"
88:30,"A PLAY CALLER, IS JOSH McDANIELS"
88:32,GETTING A LITTLE FRUSTRATED?
88:34,SOMETIMES VEREEN -- I'VE SEEN
88:36,HIM COME IN AT THE END OF OTHER
88:37,GAMES AND GIVE THEM A LITTLE
88:39,BURST.
88:39,MAYBE HE'S THINKING IT MAY BE
88:41,TIME.
88:41, HE'S GOT BLOUNT.
88:42,THEY ALSO PUT THE FULLBACK IN
88:43,"THERE, DEVELIN."
88:48,"AND BRADY, OFF PLAY-ACTION,"
88:49,THROWS.
88:50,CAUGHT.
88:51,IT WILL BE A GAIN CLOSE TO A
88:53,FIRST DOWN.
88:53,DEVELIN MAKES THE CATCH.
88:55,HE SCORED A TOUCHDOWN IN THE AFC
88:57,CHAMPIONSHIP GAME.
88:58,THAT'S GONNA TAKE US TO THE
89:00,FOURTH QUARTER.
89:01,"SEAHAWKS OWNER PAUL ALLEN, G.M."
89:03,JOHN SCHNEIDER.
89:03,PAUL ALLEN BOUGHT THE TEAM IN

89:07,BILL GATES.
89:08,LEFT THERE IN '83.
89:10,"MADE A TON OF MONEY, BUT HE'S"
89:11,BEEN A PHENOMENAL
89:12,PHILANTHROPIST.
89:13,MICROSOFT ALL OVER THE PLACE

89:18,"OF DOLLARS TO FIGHT DISEASES,"
89:20,"MEDICAL RESEARCH FACILITIES, AND"
89:22,ALL OF THE REST.

89:41,IN A 10-POINT GAME.
89:44,BLOUNT.
89:46,GOT HIM BY THE SHIRTTAIL.
89:48,CAN'T GET AWAY.
89:50,TONY McDANIEL WAS ABLE TO BRING
89:53,HIM BACK.
89:55,AND THEY HAVE TO PUNT ON A
89:57,FOURTH DOWN.
89:59, WE DON'T TALK ABOUT THEM
90:01,"MUCH, BUT TONY McDANIEL,"
90:02,"KEVIN WILLIAMS, RIGHT UP THE"
90:04,"MIDDLE, THE BIG GUYS."
90:05,WHEN YOU HAVE TO HAVE A STOP IN
90:07,"A THIRD-AND-1 SITUATION, YOU"
90:09,HAVE TO GET IN THE BACKFIELD TO
90:10,BE ABLE TO SLOW DOWN A
90:12,LeGARRETTE BLOUNT.
90:13,THEY GOT THE JOB DONE THERE.
90:14, WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THE
90:16,TEAR-AWAY JERSEYS?
90:17, [ CHUCKLES ]
90:18, LOW LINE-DRIVE KICK.
90:20,COMING UP TO FIELD IT IS

90:24,AND HE GETS TACKLED AT THE
90:26,35-YARD LINE.
90:30, HERE WE GO.
90:31,A LITTLE HARDBALL WITH
90:33,CHRIS MATTHEWS.
90:34,DOWN THE FIELD.
90:35,THIS IS THE ONE.
90:36,THIS OFFENSE WAS STUCK IN THE
90:37,MUD UNTIL MATTHEWS MADE THAT
90:39,PLAY.
90:39,"RIGHT BEFORE THE HALF, 6 SECONDS"
90:41,"TO GO, WHO DO YOU THROW IT TO?"
90:42,"OF COURSE, THE GUY THAT DOESN'T"
90:45,HAVE A CATCH ALL YEAR.
90:46,AND THEN DOWN THE FIELD AGAINST
90:48,ARRINGTON.
90:49,"OH, MAYBE A LITTLE PUSH-OFF."
90:50,GETS AWAY WITH IT.
90:52,HE HAS BEEN THE DIFFERENCE IN
90:54,THE GAME.

91:08,"STORE, SELLING SHOES, WHEN"
91:10,"SEATTLE CALLED AND SAID, ""GET"
91:11,"UP HERE FOR A TRYOUT."""
91:13, YOU CAN'T MAKE THIS UP.
91:15, YOU'RE RIGHT.
91:16,YOU CANNOT MAKE THIS UP.
91:18,FROM THE 36-YARD LINE.
91:19,THAT'S WHAT WE LOVE ABOUT
91:21,SPORTS.
91:21,GAIN OF 3 FOR MARSHAWN LYNCH.
91:26, NOW I THINK YOU'RE STARTING
91:27,TO SEE SOME RUN BLITZES HERE OUT
91:29,OF THE NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS.
91:31,HERE COMES JAMIE COLLINS.
91:32,THIS IS NOT EXPECTING A PASS.
91:34,THAT IS SO THEY CAN CLOG UP THE
91:36,MIDDLE AGAINST MARSHAWN LYNCH
91:38,AND CREATE SOME OPPORTUNITIES
91:39,"FOR THE OTHER LINEBACKER THERE,"
91:41,"DONT'A HIGHTOWER, TO COME OVER"
91:43,AND HELP MAKE THE TACKLE.
91:46, SECOND AND 8.

92:08,LOOK AT TRYING TO BLOCK THAT
92:10,GUY.

92:12,BUT ANYTIME YOU SEE
92:14,"VINCE WILFORK -- CONTACT, ARMS"
92:16,FULLY EXTENDED.
92:17,THAT MEANS HE'S TOTALLY UNDER

94:38,"FOR TOM BRADY, YOU KNOW, I THINK"

94:44,THEN HE PLAYED A LOT OF DEFENSE
94:46,THE FIRST WEEK.
94:47,"THEN THEY GET HERE, HE DID THAT"
94:48,INTERVIEW WITH BOB ON TUESDAY.
94:49, WHICH LOOKED A LITTLE
94:50,UNCERTAIN.
94:51, HE WAS ALL OVER THE PLACE.
94:52,BUT THEN HE TOLD YOU -- AS YOU
94:54,LOOK AT ROGER GOODELL -- HE TOLD
94:55,YOU ON WEDNESDAY TO YOUR FACE.
94:56," I SAID, ""TOM, LOOK ME IN THE"

99:07,"DEMARCUS DOBBS, DROPS BACK"
99:09,"IN COVERAGE, AND BRADY"
99:10,BRILLIANTLY JUST WAITS FOR HIM
99:12,TO GET ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE
99:13,DEFENSIVE LINEMAN.
99:14,"EDELMAN, NICE READ."
99:16,GETS RIGHT ACROSS THE BACK SIDE
99:18,THERE OF DOBBS.
99:19,HUGE PLAY.
99:21, BALL JUST INSIDE THE 5-YARD
99:23,LINE.
99:25,8:20 REMAINING IN REGULATION.
99:29,EDELMAN HAS NOW CAUGHT 24 PASSES
99:33,IN THE THREE POSTSEASON GAMES.
99:37,VEREEN IS THE BACK.
99:40,THE FAKE TO HIM.
99:41,BRADY FIRES.
99:42,AND INCOMPLETE.
99:44,EDELMAN WAS BACKING UP.
99:45,SIMON COVERING ON THE PLAY.
99:47,"INCOMPLETE, SECOND DOWN."
99:49," OH, MY GOODNESS."
99:51,WHAT A MOVE BY JULIAN EDELMAN
99:53,HERE.
99:54,WATCH THIS ONE.
99:55,"IN, STOP ON A DIME, BACK OUT."
99:58,"COULD NOT BE MORE WIDE OPEN, AND"
100:00,BRADY MISSED THE THROW.
100:03,THAT'S AS OPEN AS YOU WILL EVER
100:05,GET DOWN ON THE GOAL LINE.
100:09,NO REASON TO HURRY THAT ONE.
100:10,"THAT WAS GAME, SET, AND MATCH."
100:13,THAT WAS TOTAL VICTORY FOR A
100:15,WIDE RECEIVER ON THE GOAL LINE.
100:17, BLOUNT IS BACK IN.
100:19,THE FAKE TO HIM.
100:20,"BRADY DANCES, THROWS."
100:22,AND IT WILL BE CAUGHT.
100:24,AMENDOLA FOR THE TOUCHDOWN!
100:31,SO NEW ENGLAND GOES FROM A
100:33,SECOND AND 18 AFTER THE FIRST
100:35,PLAY ON THIS DRIVE TO GO 68
100:36,YARDS IN NINE PLAYS AND AN EXTRA
100:39,POINT AWAY FROM MAKING IT A
100:40,3-POINT GAME.
100:42, DANNY AMENDOLA.
100:43,AS POOR AS THE LAST THROW WAS
100:45,"FROM BRADY, THIS ONE IS THAT"
100:46,GOOD.
100:47,HE JUST HAS TO WORK ON THE OTHER
100:49,SIDE OF EARL THOMAS.
100:51,HE SEES IT.
100:51,THROW IT TO THE RIGHT SHOULDER.
100:54,NO WAY THOMAS CAN GET THERE.
100:57,WHEW!
100:58,THIS GAME IS TURNING INTO
100:59,SOMETHING HERE.
101:02, WE THOUGHT IT WOULD.
101:03,BUT YOU NEVER KNOW.
101:04," SO DID THE ODDSMAKERS,"
101:05,RIGHT?
101:06," TOSS-UP, JUST ABOUT."
101:08,FIVE CATCHES FOR AMENDOLA FOR
101:10,48 YARDS.
101:12,GOSTKOWSKI FOR THE EXTRA POINT.
101:15, WE COULD BE PLAYING FOOTBALL
101:16,ALL NIGHT TONIGHT.
101:17,"EVEN IN OVERTIME, THEY PLAY"
101:19,UNTIL SOMEBODY WINS.
101:23," TOM, WITH HIS THREE T.D.s"
101:25,TONIGHT HAS NOW PASSED MONTANA.
101:28,ALL ALONE AS THE GUY THROWING
101:30,THE MOST IN THE HISTORY OF THIS
101:32,GAME.
101:33,A DOZEN.
101:34,GOSTKOWSKI'S KICK.
101:38,WILL NOT BE RUN BACK.
101:40,"GLENDALE, ARIZONA."
101:41,FOURTH-QUARTER DEFENSE FOR THESE
101:42,TWO TEAMS.
101:43,"SEATTLE'S LAST EIGHT GAMES,"
101:44,COUNTING THE TWO POSTSEASON
101:46,"GAMES, THEY'VE ALLOWED ONE"
101:47,"TOUCHDOWN, 13 POINTS, THEN WENT"
101:49,THE LAST SIX REGULAR-SEASON
101:50,GAMES WITHOUT ALLOWING A POINT
101:52,IN THE FOURTH QUARTER.
101:53,"AND THEN THE PATRIOTS, VERY"
101:54,"SIMILAR, HAVE NOT ALLOWED A"
101:56,TOUCHDOWN IN THEIR LAST EIGHT
101:57,"GAMES, COUNTING THE TWO"
101:58,POSTSEASON GAMES.
101:59,JUST FOUR FIELD GOALS.
102:01,"NOW, TONIGHT, NEW ENGLAND HAS"
102:02,"SCORED HERE IN THE FOURTH,"
102:04,AND WE'LL SEE WHAT SEATTLE CAN
102:05,MUSTER UP AS THEY START THIS
102:07,DRIVE FROM THE 20-YARD LINE.
102:17,WILSON OFF PLAY-ACTION.
102:19,SURVEYING.
102:20,TON OF TIME.
102:21,AND THEN THE RECEIVER FALLS
102:23,DOWN.
102:23,LOCKETTE LOOKS AROUND.
102:25,"HE SAYS, ""WHERE'S THE FLAG?"
102:26,"I GOT KNOCKED DOWN."""
102:27,THERE IS NO FLAG.
102:28,SECOND DOWN.
102:31," WELL, IT LOOKED LIKE BUTLER"
102:34,TRIPS HERE.
102:35,I DON'T KNOW IF THEY TRIP OVER
102:36,EACH OTHER'S FEET.
102:37,AND THEN HE REACHES OUT AND
102:39,BASICALLY TRIPS THE RECEIVER.
102:41,THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN SOME SORT
102:42,OF INTERFERENCE.
102:43,THAT WAS DEFINITELY AN
102:45,INTENTIONAL ACT.
102:48,GOT AWAY WITH IT.
102:48, HE DID.
102:49,SECOND DOWN AND 10.
102:54,TRIPS LEFT.
102:55,THREE RECEIVERS THERE.
102:57,LYNCH.
102:59,FIGHTING.
103:00,HE'S ALWAYS FIGHTING.
103:02,TO THE 25-YARD LINE.
103:03,GAIN OF 5.
103:04,THIRD AND 5.
103:04, WHAT MAKES RUSSELL WILSON
103:06,GREAT?
103:07,"ONE, HIS ESCAPABILITY."
103:09,EVEN WHEN YOU THINK YOU
103:11,COMPLETELY HAVE HIM UNDER
103:13,"CONTROL, YOU DON'T HAVE HIM"
103:14,UNDER CONTROL.
103:15,YOU'VE GOT HIM DEAD IN YOUR
103:17,"SIGHTS, YOU CAN'T GET A HAND ON"
103:18,HIM.
103:18,AND THEN THE DEEP BALLS.
103:20,"HIGH, ARCING THROWS, GIVING HIS"
103:22,RECEIVERS A CHANCE.
103:24,THOSE TWO COMPONENTS HAVE BEEN
103:26,THE DIFFERENCE HERE FOR THE
103:28,SEATTLE SEAHAWKS SO FAR.
103:30,AND AS YOU GET TO THIS POINT IN
103:32,"THE GAME, RUSSELL WILSON RUNNING"
103:33,THE BALL ALWAYS BECOMES A BIG
103:36,THREAT.
103:38, ON THIRD AND 5.
103:39,WILSON SLIDING RIGHT.
103:41,AND THEN THROWS THAT ONE OUT OF
103:43,BOUNDS.
103:44,"LYNCH GOING DOWN THE SIDELINE,"
103:45,AND INCOMPLETE.
103:46,SO IT'S A VERY FAST
103:48,THREE-AND-OUT.
103:49,EXACTLY WHAT NEW ENGLAND WAS
103:50,LOOKING FOR.
103:54, LYNCH IS GOING TO DO A
103:55,LITTLE OUT AND THEN UP.
103:56,"REALLY, HE WAS WIDE OPEN."
103:58,JAMIE COLLINS CAME UNDERNEATH
104:00,"THAT LITTLE PICK, BUT IT LOOKED"
104:01,LIKE MARSHAWN LYNCH JUST SORT OF
104:03,HESITATED AND STOPPED.
104:04,DIDN'T REALLY BELIEVE HE WAS
104:05,"GOING TO THROW IT TO HIM, I"
104:07,GUESS.
104:09," JON RYAN, WHO HAS AVERAGED"
104:12,46 YARDS A PUNT.
104:14,YOU SEE AMENDOLA BACKING UP AS
104:16,THE SHORT MAN.
104:19,POINTS BACK TO AMENDOLA.
104:21,HE'LL CALL FOR A FAIR CATCH
104:23,AND HAUL IT IN AT THE 36.
104:24,ROBERT KRAFT BOUGHT THE TEAM
104:26,"IN THE MID-'90s, TURNED A"
104:27,MEDIOCRE FRANCHISE INTO A
104:29,JUGGERNAUT.
104:30,HIS TEAMS HAVE GONE TO SEVEN
104:31,"SUPER BOWLS, INCLUDING ONE WITH"
104:33,BILL PARCELLS.
104:34,HE'S ONLY HIRED TWO COACHES.
104:35,THERE'S ONE OF THEM.
104:36,THE OTHER IS ON THE OTHER
104:37,SIDELINE.
104:37,HE INHERITED PARCELLS.
104:39,THERE IS BELICHICK WITH HIS
104:41,DEFENSE.
104:43,"OF COURSE, IT'S GOING TO BE A"
104:44,WILD LAST SEVEN MINUTES FOR THE
104:46,KRAFT FAMILY AND ALL PATRIOT
104:48,FANS.
104:48,AND WHO KNOWS WHAT THE NEXT FEW
104:50,WEEKS WILL HOLD?
104:51,FIRST THINGS FIRST.
104:53,FROM THE 36-YARD LINE.
104:55,BRADY STARTS OUT OF THE GUN.
104:57,VEREEN FLANKS HIM.
105:04,FOUR-MAN RUSH.
105:06,BRADY DUMPS.
105:07,ONE-HANDED GRAB BY VEREEN.
105:10,GAIN OF 8 YARDS.
105:11,WRIGHT AND CHANCELLOR ARE THERE.
105:13,IT'LL BE SECOND DOWN AND 2.
105:15, TOM BRADY REALLY WANTED TO
105:16,GO TO GRONKOWSKI.
105:17,"BASICALLY, THEY CAN PICK A SIDE"
105:19,BECAUSE THESE CORNERS DON'T
105:20,FLIP.
105:21,HE LOOKED OUT THERE AND THOUGHT
105:22,BETTER OF THROWING IT OVER TO
105:23,RICHARD SHERMAN'S SIDE AND THEN
105:25,GOT A BRILLIANT CATCH FROM
105:26,VEREEN.
105:27,IT IS SHANE VEREEN TIME IN THIS
105:29,GAME.
105:29,"AND, REALLY, THAT'S WHEN THEY"
105:31,WERE HAVING SUCCESS EARLY WHEN
105:33,THEY WERE WORKING THAT
105:34,EDELMAN-VEREEN COMBINATION OVER
105:36,THE MIDDLE.
105:39, SECOND AND 2.
105:45,BRADY TO THE OUTSIDE.
105:46,THAT'S ENOUGH FOR A FIRST DOWN.
105:48,THERE'S VEREEN.
105:49,CHANCELLOR MAKES THE TACKLE.
105:51,THAT MOVES THE STICKS.
105:53,FIRST DOWN TO THE 48.
105:55, THAT TIME GRONKOWSKI KNEW
105:57,IT WAS MAN COVERAGE.
105:58,RAN UP THE FIELD.
106:00,JUST MADE KAM CHANCELLOR SHUFFLE
106:02,A LITTLE BIT.
106:03,"AND ATHLETICALLY, YOU LIKE"
106:04,VEREEN ON CHANCELLOR IF YOU GET
106:06,THAT MATCH-UP.
106:07,SO WE'LL SEE IF THEY COME BACK
106:09,TO THAT.
106:17," AS WE GO DOWN THE STRETCH,"
106:18,EACH TEAM WITH ITS FULL
106:20,COMPLEMENT OF TIME-OUTS.
106:21, CHANCELLOR ONE-ON-ONE ON
106:23,GRONKOWSKI.
106:24, EDELMAN OUT OF THE SLOT.
106:26,SEND IT TO HIM.
106:27,BREAKS A TACKLE.
106:28,THEN ANOTHER.
106:29,TAKES THE BALL CLOSE TO A FIRST
106:31,DOWN.
106:32,"JULIAN EDELMAN, QUARTERBACK AT"
106:34,KENT STATE.
106:35,WHAT A PLAYER.
106:36,WHAT A FIND THIS GUY WAS.
106:37,SEVENTH-ROUND DRAFT CHOICE IN
106:39,2009
106:42," HE'S STRONG, AND HE'S"
106:43,ATHLETIC.
106:44,BUT THE THING THAT I APPRECIATE
106:46,MORE THAN ANYTHING ABOUT HIM --
106:47,GUY SHOWS UP AT THE COMPLEX AT
106:49,5:00 A.M. EVERY DAY.
106:51,"STUDIES, CATCHES EXTRA BALLS ON"
106:52,THE JUGS MACHINE.
106:53,HE'S MADE HIMSELF A GREAT PLAYER
106:55,IN THIS LEAGUE.
106:57, UNDER FIVE MINUTES.
107:02,SWING IT OUT.
107:04,VEREEN.
107:05,FIRST DOWN.
107:06,FLAG COMES DOWN.
107:07,"VEREEN LOST THE BALL, BUT HE WAS"
107:09,DOWN ALREADY.
107:10,AND WE'LL SEE ABOUT THE CALL.
107:11,"BILL VINOVICH, REFFING HIS FIRST"
107:14,SUPER BOWL GAME.
107:19,ONLY EIGHT ACCEPTED PENALTIES IN
107:21,THE GAME.
107:26, PASS INTERFERENCE.
107:28,"OFFENSE, NUMBER 11."
107:30,BLOCKING DOWNFIELD PRIOR TO THE
107:31,CATCH.
107:32,10-YARD PENALTY.
107:34,REPEAT SECOND DOWN.
107:39, SO THE CALL IS ON EDELMAN.
107:41,IT BACKS -- MIGHT BE ON
107:42,AMENDOLA.
107:43,"HE SAID 11, BUT IS THAT"
107:45,AMENDOLA?
107:45," BUT HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED, AL."
107:47,"BECAUSE OF THE PRESSURE, BRADY"
107:49,HAD TO LOB THAT PASS UP OVER THE
107:51,TOP.
107:52,SO THIS IS ONE OF THOSE DESIGNED
107:53,PLAYS WHERE YOU'RE GONNA GO DOWN
107:55,THE FIELD AND INTENTIONALLY
107:56,"BLOCK, THINKING THAT THIS PASS"
107:57,IS GOING TO COME OUT QUICKLY.
107:59,"BUT BECAUSE HE HAD TO LOB IT UP,"
108:00,"THE BLOCKING GOT THERE TOO SOON,"
108:02,SO IT'S PASS INTERFERENCE.
108:03," YEAH, HE JUST CHANGED IT."
108:04,THEY DID CALL IT ON AMENDOLA.
108:06,BRUCE IRVIN ALMOST GOT A HAND ON
108:07,IT.
108:08,"SO INSTEAD OF SECOND AND 1, IT'S"
108:09,SECOND AND 11.
108:12,WE GOT SHERMAN ON LaFELL.
108:14,THEY HAVEN'T GONE SHERMAN'S WAY.
108:16,STAYING AWAY FROM HIM.
108:17,MUCH AS AARON RODGERS DID ON
108:19,OPENING NIGHT.
108:20,BRADY.
108:20,HIT AS HE THROWS.
108:22,CAUGHT BY GRONKOWSKI!
108:23,AND THE BIG BULL TAKES IT TO THE
108:25,32-YARD LINE.
108:31, THEY'RE ROLLING THE DICE
108:33,HERE.
108:33,THEY'RE PUTTING THEIR BIG
108:35,"SAFETY, KAM CHANCELLOR, ON"
108:36,GRONKOWSKI.
108:37,EARLIER THEY GOT BURNED WITH
108:38,K.J. WRIGHT.
108:39,YOU WANT TO GO MAN COVERAGE --
108:41,"AND I THINK A LITTLE BIT,"
108:42,BECAUSE SHANE VEREEN'S BEEN
108:43,EFFECTIVE COMING OUT OF THE
108:45,"BACKFIELD, THEY'VE HAD TO"
108:46,CHANGE UP THEIR SECONDARY
108:47,COVERAGE A LITTLE BIT.
108:49,AND RIGHT NOW JOSH McDANIELS
108:50,GOT IT GOING WITH THIS
108:51,PLAY CALLING.
108:56, BRADY HUNG IN UNDER PRESSURE.
109:02,BALL AT THE 32.
109:07,ALREADY WITHIN GOSTKOWSKI'S
109:09,FIELD-GOAL RANGE.
109:14,BRADY WILL SWING IT OUT.
109:15,VEREEN.
109:17,"AND THERE'S RICHARD SHERMAN,"
109:19,WHOSE GIRLFRIEND IS PREGNANT.
109:20,"SHE'S DUE IN ABOUT TWO WEEKS,"
109:22,BUT SHE'S HERE.
109:23,HE'S READY TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL
109:25,IN UNIFORM IF NEED BE.
109:26," WELL, AND RICHARD WAS TELLING"
109:28,"US THAT SHE SAID, ""YOU GO PLAY"
109:30,THE SUPER BOWL.
109:31,DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.
109:32,I'VE GOT ALL THAT SET UP IF
109:34,SOMETHING GETS ACCELERATED
109:36,"HERE."""
109:37, LOOK AT THAT.
109:38,THROWN AT ONE TIME.
109:40,ONCE.
109:40,"RICHARD SAYS, ""IT'S EVERYTHING I"
109:42,CAN DO TO KEEP FROM GETTING
109:44,"BORED."""
109:45, I GUARANTEE HE'S NOT BORED
109:47,RIGHT NOW.
109:48, MNH-MNH.
109:49,SECOND AND 10.
109:51,LITTLE MORE THAN 4 TO GO.
109:57,BRADY FIRES.
109:59,CAUGHT.
109:59,FIRST DOWN.
110:00,AND AGAIN THEY GO TO GRONKOWSKI.
110:03,OUT AT THE 20-YARD LINE.
110:08," AL, HERE IT IS AGAIN."
110:09,THEY'RE JUST TELLING TOM BRADY
110:11,THIS IS MAN COVERAGE.
110:12,HE'S OFF.
110:13,HE'S INSIDE.
110:13,HE'S LOOKING RIGHT AT
110:15,GRONKOWSKI.
110:15,EVERYBODY IN THE BUILDING THAT
110:17,KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT FOOTBALL
110:19,KNOWS THAT'S MAN COVERAGE.
110:20,"AND 1,000% OF THE TIME NOW, THEY"
110:22,ARE GONNA THROW IT RIGHT THERE
110:24,WHEN THEY GET THAT LOOK.
110:26, HALF A DOZEN CATCHES FOR
110:28,HIM.
110:28,NOW THROUGH THE MIDDLE.
110:30,"BIG HOLE FOR VEREEN, AND HE"
110:32,TAKES THE BALL TO THE 12-YARD
110:33,LINE.
110:36,BOBBY WAGNER IS THERE.
110:38,"YOU KNOW, 3:20, YOU BEGIN TO"
110:39,THINK ABOUT USING THE CLOCK.
110:40,THEY'RE ALREADY IN FIELD-GOAL
110:42,"RANGE, BUT SEATTLE STILL HAS ALL"
110:43,OF ITS TIME-OUTS.
110:44,YOU STILL HAVE THE 2-MINUTE
110:45,WARNING.
110:46,YOU'RE STILL GOING TO HAVE FOUR
110:47,OPPORTUNITIES TO STOP THE
110:48,CLOCK.
110:49, THIS IS ABOUT SCORING A
110:50,TOUCHDOWN RIGHT HERE.
110:51, CORRECT.
110:52,ANY WAY YOU CAN AT ANY TIME YOU
110:54,CAN.
110:54, NO CLOCK MANAGEMENT.
110:55, NOT YET.
110:56,NOT YET.
110:58,THREE MINUTES TO GO.
111:00,SECOND AND 3.
111:06,BRADY TO THE OUTSIDE.
111:07,CAUGHT -- AND THAT'S LaFELL --
111:09,BEFORE HE STEPS OUT OF BOUNDS.
111:10,HE IS OUT OF BOUNDS AT THE
111:12,"6-YARD LINE, AND THAT MAKES IT"
111:14,FIRST AND GOAL WITH 2:52 ON THE
111:16,CLOCK.
111:18, THEY FINALLY COME OUT OF
111:20,THAT MAN COVERAGE AND GO A ZONE.
111:23,BUT THEY'RE REALLY LUCKY THAT
111:27,LaFELL ON THAT ONE COULDN'T GET
111:29,HIMSELF UNDER CONTROL.
111:30,BECAUSE I THINK HE WOULD HAVE
111:31,SCORED.
111:32, 71 IS REPORTING AS ELIGIBLE.
111:33,7-1 IS AN ELIGIBLE RECEIVER.
111:35, YOU HEAR THE ANNOUNCEMENT.
111:37,"FLEMING COMES IN, THE TACKLE, AS"
111:38,AN ELIGIBLE RECEIVER -- 71.
111:42,EARL THOMAS PLAYING THE MIDDLE.
111:46,BRADY LOOKING AT THE CLOCK.
111:48,"BRADY SAYS, ""I'LL TAKE A"
111:49,"TIME-OUT."""
111:49,PLAY CLOCK WAS ALL THE WAY DOWN
111:50,TO :02.
111:51,TOM WILL GO TO THE SIDELINE.
111:55, FIRST CHARGED TIME-OUT.
111:57, TOM BRADY TONIGHT HAS PUT IT
112:00,UP 49 TIMES.
112:02,THE 36 COMPLETIONS IS A
112:04,SUPER BOWL RECORD.
112:09,CRAZY TWO WEEKS.
112:11,GREAT GAME.
112:13,WHO KNOWS WHAT THE IMMEDIATE
112:14,FUTURE WILL HOLD?
112:18," YOU KNOW, I THINK"
112:19,EVERYBODY -- WE KNOW THE
112:21,RAMIFICATIONS OF WHAT TED WELLS'
112:24,INVESTIGATION IS GOING TO BE.
112:26,SOMEBODY IS GOING TO COME OUT OF
112:28,THIS WITH EGG ON THEIR FACE.
112:29,"EITHER THE PATRIOTS, THE LEAGUE"
112:31,"OFFICE, THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE"
112:32,ACCUSED THE PATRIOTS.
112:33,ALL THAT STUFF'S IN PLAY.
112:35,BUT ISN'T IT GLORIOUS JUST FOR
112:37,"THESE THREE OR FOUR HOURS HERE,"
112:39,THAT YOU CAN JUST ENJOY A
112:40,FOOTBALL GAME?
112:41," WELL, AS THE OLD COACH"
112:43,"JOHN MADDEN ALWAYS SAID, ""YOU"
112:45,"KNOW, A GAME BREAKS OUT."""
112:46,AND IT BROKE OUT TONIGHT.
112:48, BUT THERE ARE -- IT IS GOING
112:50,TO BE BIG IN THE FOLLOWING
112:52,MONTH.
112:53," AGAIN, FLEMING AN ELIGIBLE"
112:55,"RECEIVER, NUMBER 71."
112:56,FIRST AND GOAL.
112:57,THE BALL AT THE 6.
112:59,"DEVELIN, THE FULLBACK."
113:01,BLOUNT IS THE RUNNING BACK.
113:03,BLOUNT.
113:04,AND BLOUNT POWERING HIS WAY TO
113:07,THE 3-YARD LINE.
113:08,STOPPED THERE.
113:09,GAIN OF 3.
113:10,SECOND DOWN AND GOAL.
113:13, THEY'RE GONNA TRY AND LOAD UP
113:15,AND GO WITH THE BIG POWER
113:17,"RUNNER, EVEN THOUGH IT'S"
113:18,BASICALLY BEEN VEREEN AND THE
113:20,MATCH-UP PROBLEMS THAT HE HAS
113:22,CREATED THAT'S GOTTEN THEM DOWN
113:24,THE FIELD HERE.
113:29, UNDER 2:30.
113:31,BLOUNT OUT.
113:33,VEREEN IN.
113:41,SECOND AND GOAL.
113:50,BRADY.
113:51,CAUGHT -- TOUCHDOWN!
113:53,JULIAN EDELMAN!
113:57," CAME BACK TO IT, AL."
113:58,THEY CAME RIGHT BACK TO IT.
114:10,"DOWN, BACK OUT."
114:12,WORKED BRILLIANTLY BEFORE.
114:14,BRADY MISSED THE PASS.
114:16,"COME RIGHT BACK TO IT, AND"
114:18,EDELMAN GETS IT DONE.
114:20,NO PUSH-OFF.
114:21,NO FOUL.
114:22,NO NOTHING.
114:23,AND TOM BRADY TAKES THEM RIGHT
114:25,DOWN THE FIELD.
114:26," AND THERE AGAIN, THEY GO TO"
114:28,"WORK ON THAROLD SIMON, WHO TOOK"
114:30,THE PLACE OF THE INJURED
114:31,JEREMY LANE.
114:33,THEY PICKED ON HIM EARLY.
114:34,HE GOT HIS FEET UNDER HIM.
114:36,PLAYED WELL FOR ABOUT A QUARTER
114:37,AND A HALF.
114:38,THEY GO BACK THAT WAY AGAIN AND
114:40,BURN HIM.
114:44,GOSTKOWSKI FOR THE EXTRA POINT.
114:47,AND THAT MAKES IT A 4-POINT
114:50,"LEAD, MEANING SEATTLE'S GONNA"
114:51,NEED A TOUCHDOWN.
114:53,LAST TWO NEW ENGLAND DRIVES --
114:56,"9 PLAYS FOR 68, 10 PLAYS FOR 64."
115:04,AND THE KRAFT FAMILY -- ROBERT
115:06,AND JONATHAN.
115:08,THEY'VE SEEN A FEW EXCITING
115:10,GAMES.
115:10,"AGAIN, YOU'VE GOT A CLOSE GAME."
115:12,EVERY SUPER BOWL THAT
115:14,NEW ENGLAND'S PLAYED IN SINCE
115:16,BELICHICK AND BRADY TOOK OVER
115:17,HAS BEEN DECIDED BY 4 OR LESS.
115:20,RUSSELL WILSON'S BEEN HERE
115:21,BEFORE.
115:22,"HECK, HE WAS DOWN 16-0 TWO"
115:24,WEEKS AGO.
115:25, I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK OF
115:27,WHAT RUSSELL WILSON TOLD US.
115:29,"HE SAID, THE MINUTE I PULLED"
115:31,THAT TROPHY DOWN -- I HELD IT UP
115:33,"IN THE AIR AND I PULLED IT DOWN,"
115:35,AND I STARTED THINKING ABOUT THE
115:37,NEXT ONE.
115:38,I STARTED THINKING ABOUT THE
115:40,"NEXT SUPER BOWL OPPORTUNITY."""
115:43,HE SAID HE WANTED SIX.
115:44,HE GREW UP REMEMBERING
115:46,MICHAEL JORDAN HOLDING UP SIX
115:48,FINGERS.
115:48,"HE SAID, ""I'M LOOKING FOR SIX."""
115:50,THIS SECOND ONE IS GOING TO BE
115:52,ON HIS SHOULDERS WITH TWO
115:54,MINUTES TO GO.
116:00, SO 2:02.
116:02,"IF THE KICKOFF IS A TOUCHBACK,"
116:03,THEY'RE GOING TO GET A PLAY
116:05,BEFORE THE 2-MINUTE WARNING.
116:06,"OTHERWISE, THE CLOCK'S GOING TO"
116:08,STOP.
116:08,THEY HAVE ALL OF THEIR
116:09,TIME-OUTS.
116:13,AND GOSTKOWSKI WILL SEND THAT
116:15,ONE DEEP INTO THE NIGHT.
116:17,SO THEY WILL GET ONE PLAY OFF
116:19,BEFORE THE 2-MINUTE WARNING.
116:21,"THAT WILL STOP THE CLOCK, AND"
116:22,THEY'LL PRESERVE THEIR THREE
116:23,TIME-OUTS.
116:34,PATRIOTS OVERCOMING A 10-POINT
116:36,DEFICIT.
116:40,"AGAIN, WE GO BACK TO BRADY"
116:44,"TELLING US YESTERDAY, ""THERE"
116:46,WOULD NOT BE A GAME I WOULD WANT
116:48,"TO WIN MORE THAN THIS ONE."""
117:04,LYNCH GETS FLANKED OUT.
117:12,EMPTY BACKFIELD.
117:14,WILSON.
117:15,DOWN THE SIDELINE.
117:17,LYNCH MAKES THE CATCH!
117:18,AND HE'LL GET TACKLED BY
117:20,JAMIE COLLINS.
117:20,"BUT THAT'S A BIG GAIN, TAKING US"
117:22,TO THE 2-MINUTE WARNING.
117:24,THEY STILL HAVE THEIR THREE
117:25,TIME-OUTS.
117:26, WHAT A CALL THAT WAS BY
117:28,DARRELL BEVELL.
117:29,RUSSELL WILSON SAW
117:30,MARSHAWN LYNCH ONE-ON-ONE
117:31,"AGAINST THE LINEBACKER,"
117:33,JAMIE COLLINS.
117:34,SLANT AND GO.
117:36,TO A RUNNING BACK.
117:38,THAT IS CONFIDENCE IN THE
117:39,ABILITY OF NOT JUST
117:41,"RUSSELL WILSON, BUT"
117:42,MARSHAWN LYNCH.
117:43,AND A TRUST WITH THE SEASON ON
117:46,THE LINE.
117:47,BRILLIANT CALL.
117:48,BRILLIANT THROW.
117:49,AND NOW THEY'RE AT MIDFIELD.
117:51,COULD THIS GAME BE ANY BETTER?
117:52, MM-MM-MMM.
117:54,"PLENTY LEFT, TOO."
117:57,1:55.
117:57,THAT WAS LYNCH'S FIRST CATCH OF
118:00,THE GAME.
118:07,THEY BLITZ.
118:09,WILSON FIRES.
118:10,AND THAT'S INCOMPLETE.
118:12,INTENDED FOR KEARSE.
118:13,LOOKS AROUND FOR A FLAG.
118:14,GETS NONE.
118:15,"MALCOLM BUTLER, THE ROOKIE OUT"
118:16,"OF WEST ALABAMA, A FREE AGENT,"
118:19,WITH THE DEFENSE.
118:20, CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT THIS
118:21,ROOKIE IS THINKING?
118:22,AND HE COULD NOT HAVE PLAYED
118:24,THIS BETTER.
118:24,PERFECT POSITION.
118:25,"GOING TO COME, JUMP INSIDE,"
118:27,KNOCK IT AWAY.
118:28,BRILLIANT PLAY.
118:30, MM-MMM.
118:36,FROM THE 49.
118:38,SECOND AND 10.
118:50,PLAY CLOCK AT :01.
118:52,AND NOW WILSON HAS TO TAKE A
118:53,TIME-OUT.
118:54,"SO THEY HAVE THREE, SO HE TAKES"
118:56,ONE HERE.
118:56,PLAY CLOCK WAS ALL THE WAY DOWN.
118:58," FIRST CHARGED TIME-OUT,"
119:00,SEATTLE.
119:03,30-SECOND TIME-OUT.
119:08, YOU KNOW WHAT'S INTERESTING?
119:10,"CHRIS MATTHEWS, WHO'S HAD THE"
119:12,"UNBELIEVABLE GAME, BECAUSE TEAMS"
119:15,"WORK ON PACKAGES OF PLAYS, AND"
119:18,SO WHEN YOU GET IN THE 2-MINUTE
119:20,"OFFENSE, THEY'VE PRACTICED WITH"
119:22,THE GUYS THAT THEY HAVE IN
119:23,THERE -- BALDWIN AND LOCKETTE
119:25,AND KEARSE.
119:26,AND SO HE HASN'T BEEN A PART OF
119:27,THIS.
119:28,AND YET IF YOU'VE WATCHED THE
119:29,"GAME, YOU KNOW HE'S THE ONE THAT"
119:31,SORT OF BROKE IT OPEN.
119:33, SURE.
119:33,NOW HE'S COMING IN.
119:35,HE'LL BE A PART OF THIS NEXT
119:38,PLAY HERE ON SECOND DOWN AND 10.
119:40,MATTHEWS HAS CAUGHT 4 FOR 109
119:43,YARDS AND A TOUCHDOWN.
119:46,SECOND AND 10.
119:47,TWO TIME-OUTS NOW LEFT FOR THE
119:50,SEAHAWKS.
119:53,KEY GUYS ON THE FIELD.
119:54,"WILLSON, THE TIGHT END, HAS NOT"
119:56,CAUGHT A PASS IN THIS GAME.
120:04,DEEP DROP.
120:07,TON OF TIME.
120:08,GOING FOR IT ALL.
120:10,KNOCKED AWAY.
120:11,BROWNER IS BACK THERE.
120:12,THERE WAS MATTHEWS.
120:14,"AND BRANDON BROWNER, WHO WAS A"
120:15,SEAHAWK LAST YEAR BUT WAS
120:17,SUSPENDED AT THE END OF THE
120:18,SEASON AND HAD TO WATCH THE
120:20,SUPER BOWL -- HAS A RING -- AND
120:22,THEN LEFT FOR NEW ENGLAND IN
120:24,FREE AGENCY.
120:25, GONNA GO RIGHT UP THE SEAM
120:26,HERE.
120:27,THE PATRIOTS CAME WITH A
120:28,THREE-MAN RUSH.
120:29,AND THEY MADE THIS SWITCH EARLY.
120:31,"AND I THINK, FOR MATT PATRICIA,"
120:33,IT'S BEEN A GOOD ONE.
120:35,"THE JUMP BALLS, NOW THAT YOU"
120:36,"HAVE A 6'4"" CORNERBACK, ARE A"
120:38,"LITTLE MORE FAIR, LITTLE MORE"
120:40,FAVORABLE FOR THE PATRIOTS.
120:43, THIRD AND 10.
120:46,FLANK LYNCH AGAIN.
120:49,WILSON.
120:49,HANGS IN THERE.
120:50,THROWS.
120:51,THAT'S CAUGHT.
120:51,THAT'S GOING TO BE A FIRST DOWN.
120:53,38-YARD LINE.
120:54,RICARDO LOCKETTE.
120:55,AND NOW THEY'LL HUSTLE UP TO
120:56,"THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE,"
120:58,PRESERVING THE TIME-OUTS.
120:59,UNDER 1:30 TO GO.
121:02, WE'VE SEEN WHEN LOGAN RYAN
121:03,HAS BEEN IN THE GAME -- THE PLAY
121:05,RIGHT BEFORE THE HALF AND NOW --
121:07,THEY'RE COMING BACK TO HIM.
121:08,LOCKETTE IS A GUY WITH BRILLIANT
121:10,"SPEED, SO RYAN HAS TO BE"
121:12,CAREFUL.
121:17, RUSSELL IN THE POCKET.
121:18,"RUSSELL FOR KEARSE, AND IT'S"
121:20,BROKEN UP AGAIN.
121:22,AND IS IT -- BUT SOMEHOW...
121:24, HOLY COW.
121:25, DID HE WIND UP WITH THE
121:27,FOOTBALL?
121:28, I THINK BUTLER HIT IT AND IT
121:30,FELL RIGHT BACK DOWN TO THE
121:31,GROUND.
121:34,UNBELIEVABLE!
121:37,"THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED,"
121:38,ISN'T IT?
121:39," WELL, KEARSE GOES FOR IT."
121:42,IT'S STILL NOT ON THE GROUND.
121:43,IT'S STILL NOT ON THE GROUND.
121:44,"IT'S STILL -- WHOA, LOOK AT"
121:45,THAT.
121:46,PHENOMENAL.
121:46, I CAN'T BELIEVE HE DIDN'T GET
121:48,UP AND GET IN THE END ZONE IN
121:49,TIME.
121:50, AND THEN BUTLER TAKES HIM
121:52,OUT.
121:52,"SO HE BREAKS UP THE PLAY, BUT"
121:54,AT THE END OF THE DAY -- LOOK AT
121:56,THAT.
121:57,DOES A JUGGLING ACT.
121:58,HAS IT AT THE 5.
121:59,FIRST AND GOAL.
122:00,33 YARDS.
122:06,"AND NOW, BY THE TIME THEY GET"
122:07,"DOWN THERE, THE PLAY CLOCK HAS"
122:09,RUN OUT AGAIN.
122:10, SECOND CHARGED TIME-OUT.
122:12, AND SEATTLE TAKES A TIME-OUT.
122:14,CRAZY!
122:15, HOW MANY DIFFERENT PLAYS ARE
122:17,THE PATRIOTS GOING TO HAVE LIKE
122:19,THIS?
122:20,"MARIO MANNINGHAM, DAVID TYREE."
122:23,AND NOW KEARSE.
122:24, THIS WAS WHERE TYREE HAD THE
122:26,HELMET CATCH.
122:27,THIS WAS THE SCENE OF THE CRIME
122:29,FOR NEW ENGLAND.
122:30, AND TOM BRADY HAD THAT LOOK
122:31,"ON HIS FACE LIKE, ""YOU GOT TO"
122:33,BE KIDDING ME.
122:34,"NOT AGAIN."""
122:36, HERE YOU GO BACK TO
122:38,SUPER BOWL XLII.
122:39,TYREE MAKES THE CATCH.
122:41,OUR BUDDY RODNEY HARRISON HAD A
122:43,BIRD'S-EYE VIEW.
122:45,PLAXICO BURRESS WINDS UP WITH
122:47,THE TOUCHDOWN TO WIN THE GAME
122:49,AND END WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A
122:51,PERFECT SEASON FOR THE PATRIOTS.
122:54,THEY WERE 18-0 COMING IN.
122:56," YOU KNOW, AL, YOU PLAY 16"
122:58,"GAMES, COUPLE OF PLAYOFF GAMES,"
123:00,AND IT COMES DOWN TO ONE TIPPED
123:03,BALL THAT FALLS ON THE GROUND
123:05,TO SOMEBODY WHO'S LYING ON HIS
123:07,BACK.
123:08,[ BOTH LAUGH ]
123:10," PAUL ALLEN HAS SEEN IT ALL,"
123:11,BUT NOT THAT.
123:12,LOOK AT THAT.
123:13, BUT THEY'RE NOT IN YET.
123:17," AND THERE'S DURON HARMON, WHO"
123:19,COMES OVER THE TOP.
123:20,HE HAD A CHANCE TO MAYBE KICK IT
123:21,AWAY.
123:23,KEARSE COMES UP WITH IT.
123:25,AMAZING.
123:26,THE BALL AT THE 5.
123:27, NOW YOU HAVE TO STOP
123:29,MARSHAWN LYNCH.
123:33, HERE HE GOES.
123:34,BEAST MODE.
123:36,TO THE HALF-YARD LINE.
123:39,AND NOW NEW ENGLAND HAS TO THINK
123:41,ABOUT TAKING A TIME-OUT.
123:45," BOY, THE LAST TIME WE CALLED"
123:47,"A SUPER BOWL, AL, REMEMBER?"
123:48, AHMAD BRADSHAW.
123:49, DO YOU LET THEM SCORE?
123:50,DO YOU PUT THE BALL BACK IN THE
123:51,HANDS OF TOM BRADY?
123:55,AND I GUARANTEE YOU
123:56,BILL BELICHICK IS SITTING HERE
123:58,THINKING ABOUT IT RIGHT NOW.
123:59, IT'S ON HIS MIND.
124:01,IT HAS TO BE.
124:02,DO YOU BLEED THE CLOCK ALL THE
124:03,WAY DOWN?
124:04,THEY'RE BLEEDING IT RIGHT DOWN
124:06,TO HALF A MINUTE.
124:07,SECOND AND GOAL.
124:08,BALDWIN SETS UP ON THE LEFT.

124:34,CELEBRATION.
124:35,AMAZING!
124:39,"BUTLER, A ROOKIE FREE AGENT OUT"
124:42,OF WEST ALABAMA.

124:46,"THEY TRIED TO GO HERE, BUT HE"
124:48,BEATS HIM TO THE PUNCH.
124:49,"AND I'M SORRY, BUT I CAN'T"
124:51,BELIEVE THE CALL.
124:52, ME NEITHER.
124:53, I CANNOT BELIEVE THE CALL.
124:54,YOU'VE GOT MARSHAWN LYNCH IN THE
124:56,BACKFIELD.
124:57,YOU'VE GOT A GUY THAT'S BEEN
124:59,BORDERLINE UNSTOPPABLE IN THIS
125:01,PART OF THE FIELD.
125:02,I CAN'T BELIEVE THE CALL.
125:05, AND THERE'S BRADY.

125:15,"""WHAT?"""
125:18,I AGREE WITH YOU.
125:19,WHY MAKE THAT CALL?
125:19,YOU'RE DOWN ON THE HALF-YARD
125:21,LINE.
125:24, WE HAVE UNSPORTSMANLIKE
125:26,CONDUCT AGAINST THE NEW ENGLAND
125:28,BENCH AFTER THE INTERCEPTION.
125:30,THE PENALTY WILL BE HALF THE
125:31,DISTANCE TO THE GOAL.
125:33,NEW ENGLAND KEEPS THE BALL.
125:35,FIRST DOWN.
125:36," WELL, IT'S HALF THE DISTANCE"
125:37,"TO THE GOAL, WHICH IS NEXT TO"
125:38,NOTHING.
125:40,AND NOW SEATTLE HAD TO USE TWO
125:42,"TIME-OUTS, SO THEY CAN ONLY STOP"
125:44,THE CLOCK ONCE.
125:45,AND BARRING COMPLETE INSANITY --
125:48,AND I MEAN COMPLETE...
125:50, I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

125:55,ABSOLUTELY CANNOT BELIEVE THAT
125:58,PLAY CALL.
126:00,IF I LOSE THE SUPER BOWL BECAUSE

126:40,THE BALL OUT OF THE END ZONE.
126:42,"OTHERWISE, IT WOULD BE 2 POINTS"
126:44,AND THEY'D HAVE TO HAVE A FREE
126:46,KICK FROM THE 20.
