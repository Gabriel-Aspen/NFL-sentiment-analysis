00:36,the sideline he's got a record of four
00:38,and two
00:40,he plays in his seventh and he's already
00:43,pump on the fist and yelling on the
00:45,sideline before this Super Bowl start
00:48,my nickman here we go starting from the
00:51,25
01:03,starting with a flower the pass in
01:06,control
01:07,for Edelman and he got popped
01:11,last guy to hit him was Devon drake
01:13,campbell the rookie line up linebacker
01:15,and we'll give you the lineups and we'll
01:17,give you a look at the skilled players
01:19,we'll see kind of a three-headed monster
01:22,at the running back position for the new
01:24,Patriots
01:27,that upfront a much-improved offensive
01:29,line with the
01:30,Andrews in the middle of sinner improved
01:33,from the year ago second
01:35,[Applause]
01:47,find gentlemen

01:51,gets nine brought down by Philip wheeler
01:53,third down and one coming up you see Tom
01:57,Brady he's able to slide in the pocket
01:59,certainly one of the big keys for this
02:01,Atlanta Falcons defenses will they be
02:03,able to get pressure on Tom Brady he
02:06,slides and maneuvers within the pocket
02:08,as well as anybody not a threat as a
02:11,runner
02:12,[Applause]
02:17,Jones a whoopie linebacker is in there
02:20,to make the step for Atlanta and it's
02:22,three and out to start the game for the
02:24,Patriots
02:26,well Dion Jones number 45 right in the
02:29,middle he has really come on strong here
02:32,at the end of this season he's able to
02:33,shoot the gap he makes a play on
02:35,LeGarrette Blount that is a great start
02:38,for this young defensive unit to get off
02:40,the field with a three now
02:42,[Applause]
02:47,we've a veteran waiting deep there has
02:50,never been a punt return for a touchdown
02:52,in Super Bowl history
02:54,[Applause]
02:59,has never been the punt return for a
03:01,touchdown in Super Bowl history and
03:03,flags are down Nate Abner it was an
03:06,Olympian on the rugby team down there to
03:09,make the stop after a 10-yard return
03:13,by receiving team sounded like 55 and
03:19,that's Paul Warlow
03:21,it was guilty of a hold
03:24,that's who it's against and here's Matt
03:25,Ryan and Troy
03:27,you know better than anybody it's what
03:29,you do in the big games it's what you do
03:31,in a game like this he came into this
03:33,postseason with a career record of one
03:35,and four
03:36,he's been outstanding getting to this
03:40,Super Bowl it really has he's done a
03:42,great job protecting the football he's
03:44,been awfully good through the two
03:45,playoff games and you can just imagine
03:47,the emotion that's going through him
03:50,right now
03:50,as he's about to take his first snap in
03:53,the Super Bowl and when you think about
03:54,Matt Ryan the only thing that has kept
03:56,him from being mentioned with the
03:58,Great's in the game on a consistent
04:00,basis his
04:02,Lombardi Trophy name is the NFL's MVP
04:05,last night starting from the 8th
04:10,Freeman on a toss running left
04:13,Matthews good start and Freeman breaks
04:16,loose Devonta Freeman welcome to the
04:19,Superbowl out to the 45 brought down by
04:22,Malcolm Butler in a carry of 37
04:27,excellent blocking here Jake Matthews
04:30,comes out you can see Julio Jones he
04:32,seals the inside they're able to stretch
04:34,it and then Devonta Freeman hits it
04:36,going north and south it's one of the
04:39,things about this running game for the
04:41,Falcons in visiting with Kyle Shanahan
04:44,he says he's got to be able to run it on
04:47,the perimeter and that's hard to do
04:49,against his Patriots defense but they do
04:51,it on the first one when they eight to
04:53,the 45 and one
04:55,it's another crack addict
04:58,Devante framelit on first time gets
05:00,three let's go back to that previous
05:02,carry by Freeman and see the blocking by
05:05,Julio Jones he's a complete receiver and
05:07,all the things that he's able to do
05:09,within the passing game and then to be
05:11,able to come up and make T blocks like
05:14,that he's a terrific player has played
05:16,through a lot but that was a great start
05:18,this Falcons office without Freeman
05:20,comes out the other half of this great
05:22,and antenna
05:24,second-tier players from in
05:26,comes in
05:36,takes it into New England territory
05:39,Patrick Shawn on the stop the gate of
05:41,three look at the skill players and
05:44,they've got a lot of them touchdown
05:46,passes from Matt Bryan 13 different
05:49,players during the course of the regular
05:52,season that's an NFL record and you talk
05:54,about Matt Ryan end of the year that
05:56,he's had well why is that because we
05:59,went out and really brought in some
06:01,quality players at the skilled position
06:03,with Mohamed Sanu Taylor Gabriel
06:05,and then of course pairing them up with
06:07,these running backs
06:09,weapon
06:11,the offensive side get the belt
06:13,chanting comment at the top of the
06:15,screen on 3rd and 4 Ryan and troubling
06:19,[Applause]
06:23,was down this is no fumble the tray
06:27,flowers made the play and it's fourth
06:30,down for Atlanta
06:32,a loss of 12 on that sack and tray
06:35,flowers has been playing brilliant
06:37,football
06:38,he sure has he came on awfully well as
06:41,the season progressed it was limited
06:43,last year and just physical with these
06:46,wide receivers at least initially Matt
06:48,Ryan was working to his right and then
06:51,flowers just able to beat Jake Matthews
06:53,and get to Matt Ryan and he clearly down
06:57,so no fumble good call and he was Carl
07:00,Jeffers the referee who made the call so
07:03,now the punt from Basia
07:06,drive it started stalls but washer hits
07:12,a beauty back inside
07:14,around the 6:00
07:17,stop short of the 10 and the first guy
07:20,there was Justin Hardy after a 55 yard
07:24,punt besides having once there's no
07:27,score early back to work
07:29,Tom Brady 60 ambassador encouraging kids
07:34,to get active for 60 minutes a day hey
07:37,lark gentleman down at the 10 here's a
07:39,handoff to Edelman
07:43,[Applause]
07:45,no flag
07:48,gets up yelling at the official dean of
07:52,to since if you watch New England and
07:55,you as you see the end of this play here
07:59,Veon Jones comes in and is able to get a
08:02,hit on him at the end of it crowd didn't
08:03,like it but to open up this game New
08:06,England spreads out the Falcons they try
08:08,to throw the football they come back on
08:10,that first down there with two tight
08:12,ends hand the ball to Edelman the
08:13,Falcons play and Wow
08:21,second down the name
08:23,hangs in and finds his top target
08:26,Edelman
08:27,they're Amendola for 13 yards in a first
08:30,down it's Adelman or Amendola two little
08:34,guys in this time it's julian edelman
08:36,for 13 we talked about the falcons and
08:40,the weapons that they have on the
08:41,offensive side of the ball these
08:42,receivers for Tom Brady are awfully good
08:46,they create some challenges of their own
08:48,Danny Amendola spent a tough year for
08:50,him he's been limited in a lot of ways
08:52,with some injuries but he is coming on
08:54,and if he can be a factor it makes
08:56,things a lot tougher he missed about a
08:57,month with an ankle injury here's Brady
08:59,has a man on the sideline it's Hogan
09:02,Paul didn't start in the championship
09:05,game against Pittsburgh nine catches 180
09:09,and two touchdowns has 15 here Chris
09:11,Hogan you know what a story he is he's
09:14,an excellent route runner working
09:16,against Jalen Collins good timing the
09:19,Falcons are getting a little bit of
09:21,pressure there on Tom Brady with that
09:23,kind of timing no way to defense that I
09:25,thought it was interesting when he
09:26,talked with Josh McDaniels Brady's
09:28,offensive coordinator and he said I
09:30,don't see Brady's eyes leaving his
09:32,targets or
09:34,going down to the pass rush at all even
09:36,at the age of 39
09:38,it's impressive
09:44,ends up with the 2 yard game the out
09:48,O'Neill on the tackle the whooping
09:50,safety and we'll look at this defense
09:52,the numbers don't knock you out for
09:54,Nathan but this is a defense that his
09:56,off the rise they're very young and they
09:59,got much better as the season went on I
10:01,sure did and how about the NFC
10:02,Championship deep when they were able to
10:04,shut out the
10:05,they're in that first half and we've
10:07,seen a lot of growth a lot of young
10:09,players but we're going to be tested
10:11,unlike ever before in this ball game
10:13,with Tom Brady
10:15,second 1/8
10:17,[Applause]
10:24,lady
10:26,to Mitchell
10:27,and Mitchell went backward a bit he's
10:29,going to be short of the first down
10:31,Malcolm Mitchell who missed two late
10:34,season games with a knee injury get
10:36,seven we third down and one
10:41,combination is the best combination
10:43,history the league as far as head coach
10:46,and quarterback and Bill Belichick and
10:48,his seven Super Bowl as a head coach he
10:51,passes Don Shula here tonight
10:58,for the second time
11:02,out of the shotgun Brady pass was behind
11:06,the clock by James wife to move
11:09,white to the 40 nice catch by the young
11:12,running back good 411 the chains white
11:15,he is a real threat as a receiver was
11:18,second on the team this year with 60
11:19,receptions they split him out he's
11:21,capable of doing a lot of things and I
11:23,motioned him back in towards the
11:25,formation and he's able to get a pretty
11:27,good release and convert the third down
11:29,Tom Brady has started 5 for 6 and set
11:32,five different receivers Cameron Fleming
11:37,an extra offensive lineman comes in
11:39,[Applause]
11:44,set to mcdeere
11:48,and it's big Courtney Upshaw who has a
11:51,Super Bowl sack and he says that's one
11:54,the loss of nine well they're trying to
11:56,get verticals through here but the
11:57,Falcons play it well and you can see
11:59,Courtney Upshaw off the play-action he's
12:01,able to come in and off the edge as well
12:04,with the pressure that's back in his
12:05,face Jack Mason
12:07,[Applause]
12:09,Patriots trying to play action take a
12:12,shot down the field the Falcons
12:14,secondary plays it well and then they
12:16,get home upfront second and 19
12:25,floats it downfield
12:29,for James White got his hands on it
12:33,couldn't secure the catch Dion Jones in
12:36,coverage if you're gonna play the
12:37,Patriots you better be able to cover
12:39,this route right here they they like
12:40,being able to get white down the field
12:43,that's a good matchup right there
12:45,between two guys that can really want
12:46,run Deon Jones is as fast as any
12:49,linebacker in football white is unable
12:52,to make a play on that one second round
12:55,pick from that last year 13 to 19
12:58,[Applause]
13:18,this time it's
13:21,Grady Jared
13:27,and thus it the Falcons decided to go
13:30,too deep and then man underneath and
13:32,they cover it up awfully well and with
13:35,time Brady just unable to find a
13:38,receiver then eventually the protection
13:40,breaks down on him it's an excellent job
13:43,to get off the field once again Allen
13:45,hits upon kind of a knuckleball and a
13:47,fair catch call core and hauled in by
13:49,Erick Wayne's 37-yard punt Malkin's
13:53,happened for the second time in this
13:54,game no score early in Super Bowl 51
13:57,brady sack 19 times in 14 games this
14:02,year 2 on that drive by the young
14:04,Atlanta defense
14:08,both backs in there
14:10,left of Matt Ryan and it's Tevin Coleman
14:15,and a nice carry on first down of nine
14:18,yards brought down by Devin McCourty go
14:21,back and take a look at Grady Jared and
14:23,where he travels from all the way around
14:25,to the left side he keeps playing in
14:27,circles back and is able to make a play
14:29,talking to Dan Quinn he said I think
14:32,Grady Jared can be a guy who can
14:34,certainly put some pressure on Tom Brady
14:36,inside it was a long way to travel to
14:41,get home second down underwater
14:56,the open is the full-back DeMarco and
14:58,he's got a first down across the 30
15:01,skivvy look at the Atlanta Falcons their
15:04,season and review they've finished with
15:06,the record of 11 and 5 they scored 540
15:11,points the most in the NFL they had six
15:14,players selected the Pro Bowl so far in
15:18,the postseason they have defeated in
15:20,Seattle beat a Green Bay advance to
15:23,their second Super Bowl and their 51
15:26,year history
15:26,[Applause]
15:34,bring it on a toss
15:37,branch was in the middle of
15:39,flowers you name it again up to about
15:45,the defense for New England is
15:46,coordinated by Matt Patricia and upfront
15:51,you see a bunch of the names not just
15:54,the starting lineup but names you will
15:56,see within this game
15:58,flowers already had sack in this game
16:00,the linebackers
16:03,the course of the season the secondary
16:05,very
16:06,second date
16:09,defense is underrated it's an awfully
16:11,good group
16:15,here's a toss to Coleman running left
16:20,[Music]
16:22,woman was looking for first down yardage
16:25,get knocked down short of it a gain of
16:26,five third and three tell you what Kyle
16:28,Shannon he's got to be awfully happy
16:31,with the way that the Falcons are
16:32,running the football they've been able
16:33,to get on the perimeter that's what they
16:36,opened the game with right there with
16:38,Jake man who's pulling out they cracked
16:39,down to seal off the end
16:42,but a number of times all
16:43,here in this first corner they've gotten
16:45,on the edge
16:47,typically difficult to do against his
16:50,Patriots defense they want to funnel
16:52,everything inside to those big guys but
16:54,the falcons they've been able to get on
16:56,the perimeter
17:00,they're down to three Ryan steps up and
17:04,is gonna slide down
17:06,with a loss on the play Allen branch was
17:09,there for the Patriots and now each
17:12,defense is made two stops a loss of two
17:15,on the play
17:18,a little zone action with the defense
17:20,they drop defensive linemen underneath
17:22,to cover up some of those underneath
17:25,throws so on third downs now when it
17:28,looks like these offenses have started
17:29,to get something going defenses have
17:32,been able to step up and make a play
17:33,play treats defense now has to third
17:35,down sacks
17:37,[Applause]
17:44,washer hits another high
17:48,[Applause]
17:51,across the 15 no marking at the 1855
17:56,yard punt nine yards on the return
18:02,which I'm ready
18:04,no first quarter points
18:08,six tribes in the Superbowl would be
18:11,shutting so far
18:12,[Applause]
18:17,start at the 18-yard line rainy good
18:20,protection Immelman first down across
18:23,the
18:24,tackle made by Pulford 13 lego
18:28,man-to-man coverage in the secondary and
18:31,julian edelman this guy is a great
18:34,receiver and you see the the move that
18:37,he's able to make on Robert Alford and
18:39,that's the guy who's going to be matched
18:41,up with Julian Edelman that is a tough
18:43,task watching to an Edelman's career he
18:46,had never played wide receiver he was a
18:47,quarterback in college and he has made
18:49,himself into one
18:51,[Applause]
19:00,to run finally for LeGarrette Blount
19:02,Alford on the tackle after a gain of
19:04,seven you talk about these running backs
19:06,Joe for the New England Patriots and
19:08,there's there's some pretty strong
19:10,tendencies when each one of these backs
19:12,is in the game and filling garret blunts
19:14,in the game most of the time they're
19:17,going to run the football on any passing
19:19,they do his play-action
19:20,so when he's in the lineup Falcons load
19:24,up it's been around but the Patriots
19:30,[Applause]
19:34,yard shot first down maybe just a little
19:37,bit more second down in three and that
19:40,will likely be the end of quarter number
19:42,one in Super Bowl 51
19:46,well it's a nothing nothing game after
19:50,one the Atlanta Falcons the New England
19:52,Patriots fans have had fun so far back
19:56,and forth no scoring the third time the
20:00,city of Houston has hosted second time
20:02,the stadium hands back in Oh for the
20:05,2003 season
20:08,Patriots run here
20:12,and here no scoring
20:15,eight scoreless first quarter in Super
20:17,Bowl history
20:18,[Applause]
20:19,this one Edelman first added more
20:25,Edelman downfield and Brady with plenty
20:28,of time finds him for 27 this is what
20:33,bass protection allows you to do
20:34,initially Tom Brady's trying to work
20:36,Danny Amendola down here at the bottom
20:39,of the screen but good coverage and so
20:41,he gets off of him and with time in the
20:43,pocket he signals gentlemen right here
20:44,to take it up the field no one is in man
20:47,coverage and then he beats him with the
20:49,ball he 1945 League IT again
20:57,33 once gets it on the hand
21:00,walls hell that paul is hell
21:04,Flanigan's down
21:09,and now the fight for the football
21:11,[Applause]
21:13,to Atlanta
21:15,flag is on the field
21:20,Bill Belichick told us
21:22,number eighty-eight offense because the
21:25,results
21:27,by the defense that penalty is
21:30,first down Atlanta
21:31,Bill Belichick told us this is the best
21:35,strip team we will face all year and
21:39,it's the rookie Deon Jones what a play
21:42,in the first turnover it belongs to
21:44,Atlanta about the rookie second round
21:47,pick out of LSU and this is a Falcons
21:50,team that practices second guy in try to
21:53,strip the ball and that happened with
21:55,Deon Jones forcing the fumble LeGarrette
21:58,Blount fumbled on the Patriots first two
22:00,games of the year
22:01,hadn't fumbled in the previous 16
22:04,straight
22:05,but it gives it land of the football
22:07,around 29
22:09,go back to a demented flash
22:12,tires
22:15,[Music]
22:16,Julio Jones somehow comes down with a
22:20,football showing how strong he is 19
22:26,yard completion what a catch and it was
22:29,unbelievable because the ball is just a
22:31,little behind with good coverage from
22:33,Logan Ryan and clearly contested and
22:36,he's just able to make a play on and
22:39,those are the kinds of things that he
22:41,does he doesn't surprise anybody on this
22:43,Falcons team they watch him in practice
22:45,he's an amazing
22:47,and he just made one at maquette worst
22:49,enemies been targeted in this first half
22:52,sound line there he is again Jones backs
22:54,out of bounds
22:56,the first down inside the 30 at the 29
22:59,good for 23 yards this is why he's so
23:02,dangerous because once he gets so far
23:04,down the field with his speed you're
23:05,threatened that he's going deep and
23:07,you've got open it up yourself but the
23:09,timing with Matt Ryan coming off of it
23:13,over to the sideline you just can't stop
23:19,first down the Falcons have been inside
23:22,Patriots territory could cut back by
23:24,Freeman leads to the 14 yard line and
23:29,another first down for Atlanta well Alex
23:33,Mack we talked about his fibula and how
23:35,he would hold up he's at center he does
23:37,an excellent job of blocking and then
23:39,Freeman reads the cut off of the zone
23:41,blocking scheme and just knocks it in
23:43,the middle
23:44,Allen branch out of the play here
23:46,streaming again what a cutback
23:50,down in here the six maybe the fun
23:51,and they're gonna mark him just inside
23:53,the sex again of nine Devonta Freeman he
23:57,can cut on a dime and he's perfect for
23:59,this Kyle Shanahan running game we saw
24:02,it on the previous play now they come
24:03,back with it the other way and he sees
24:05,the cutback once again it makes some
24:07,people miss and now Hightower is trying
24:11,to call a timeout and they finally
24:13,granted as Atlanta kept coming up to the
24:15,line in a hurry
24:17,the Patriots trying to catch their
24:19,breath trying to make the turnover turn
24:22,into points here in Super Bowl 51
24:25,Falcons during the regular season rushed
24:28,over 120 yards per game and was good for
24:31,fifth in the end
24:33,we're averaging over eleven yards of
24:35,carry here in the first half against New
24:37,England second and one
24:45,Freeman what a cut touchdown
24:49,[Applause]
25:11,but Julio Jones in the backfield are
25:13,going to show it looks like they may go
25:15,play-action and then throw the ball to
25:16,him may get defense flowing a little bit
25:18,Mohamed Sanu an excellent job of
25:19,blocking on the perimeter and an easy
25:22,touchdown and the Falcons have gashed
25:26,his defense on the ground
25:28,write it down for the point after
25:30,[Applause]
25:35,seven and up in Atlanta it started with
25:39,a stretch the wookie Dionne Jones force
25:43,the turnover dan Quint thrilled his team
25:48,turns it into seven and a lead
25:51,compliments of Freeman's
25:57,when you start out you might not know
25:59,where you're going or what you're doing
26:02,or why you're carrying this red rose
26:04,with you you just keep going keep your
26:07,focus and avoid the distractions at
26:11,times you may fall flat on your face but
26:14,technically that's still moving forward
26:15,you got to pick yourself up make some
26:18,moves and do it all with a smile believe
26:21,in yourself you think that any of these
26:23,folks believe that I'd make it
26:24,definitely not that was a rhetorical
26:26,question Darrell if you want to make an
26:30,album make an album if you want to make
26:33,a universe make a universe if you want
26:36,to play the clarinet maybe don't dress
26:38,like this but play the clarinet the
26:41,point is all dreams live within reach
26:43,all you have to do is keep moving
26:46,towards them here's to chasing dreams in
26:49,the amazing places they lead the all-new
26:52,CRV from Honda I don't wanna make it
26:58,tough I just want to tell you that I've
27:02,had enough if I sound crazy but it ain't
27:06,no lie baby bye bye bye
27:20,five calories no artificial sweeteners
27:23,and tastes amazing
27:24,buy you want to know don't you why they
27:30,keep coming here
27:37,your world is dying
27:39,[Music]
27:41,do you seek Redemption on that drive
27:59,Julio Jones had the first 42 yards
28:02,Devonta Freeman had the last 29
28:04,including the 5 yard touchdown run
28:07,for frame and his tenth rushing
28:09,touchdown over the last nine games these
28:12,two teams tied for the league low with
28:14,11 give aways offensively and then
28:17,fumble bonds but Garrett blunt leads to
28:19,the points by
28:21,[Applause]
28:26,to the end zone is Louis
28:29,tripped up as it crosses the 15 now you
28:33,can be the player and see the play
28:36,through the quarterbacks eyes see Matt
28:38,Ryan and what he sees off the play
28:40,action and he looks out there and he
28:41,sees that he's got man coverage with
28:43,safety help over the top to Julio Jones
28:45,and it's just a matter of beating him
28:48,with the ball and that's the big play
28:49,that Julio had when he got strong at the
28:52,catch and hold that one hand and right
28:55,now Joe
28:57,England Patriot team this is the first
28:59,time that they've trailed in a game
29:01,since we plum I was against the Jets and
29:04,now here they are starting at their 16
29:07,down seven
29:20,floats it toward the sideline broken up
29:22,Mitchell the target
29:25,bridge by CJ Goodwin the former receiver
29:29,in college and he's really been learning
29:31,the position of cornerback in the NFL
29:34,and now he gets to do it on the biggest
29:36,stage here in Super Bowl 51 and played
29:39,sparingly
29:40,Mitchell initially looked like he had
29:43,the ball but Goodwin he comes in and
29:45,makes a play I know it
29:47,Quinn's that Goodwin could be a factor
29:49,in this game he expected it to be more
29:52,with him instead want some of these
29:53,running backs as receivers who makes a
29:56,play there on
29:57,[Applause]
29:59,two missing
30:00,[Applause]
30:02,bring him down but then the Falcons
30:04,swarm to the ball the Cardinal Allen was
30:07,in on the tackle a gain of three Brian
30:09,Poole there as well third and seven and
30:12,they're the first three possessions for
30:14,Bill Belichick's New England Patriot
30:16,well we talked about it coming into the
30:17,game Joe as to how this young Malcolm's
30:20,team especially this defense was going
30:22,to hold up with the emotion of the game
30:24,[Applause]
30:26,have made some plays and played by
30:29,Dionne James he's had a heck of the
30:30,first half already
30:32,for spending
30:35,they're building seven
30:44,he steps up finds white and he's brought
30:47,down immediately
30:49,and there's good one again it's fourth
30:53,down after falling behind the Patriots
30:56,go three and out go Julian Edelman in
30:59,motion because Alford falls on Brady
31:01,knows he's got man coverage he comes
31:03,underneath to James why do you think
31:04,that's a good matchup running an option
31:06,route against CJ Goodwin and good one
31:09,comes up two big plays now on that drive
31:11,makes an open field tackle the force of
31:13,all
31:16,for a short pause
31:18,and it checks up
31:21,starting field position for Atlanta they
31:23,lead
31:25,start outside their own 35 and the
31:29,four-time Super Bowl champion frustrated
31:33,1037 left on the scoreboard clock and
31:36,you see the ball control
31:37,[Applause]
31:40,by New England with
31:42,by 7:00
31:44,starting at their own 38 play
31:48,wide open
31:51,and the young receiver who is cut from
31:54,the Cleveland Browns who has had a big
31:56,year games 24 so you see Julio Jones he
32:01,goes through the middle because he's
32:03,puncturing the middle of that defense it
32:05,softens up a deep safety and it allows
32:08,Gabriel to get him there uncontested
32:10,parfaits completion
32:14,has to get rid of it to the sidewalk and
32:17,to catch Julia Jones
32:18,[Applause]
32:21,water grab by number 11 gain of 18
32:27,gets both feet down and is able to
32:30,secure the catch Eric grow in coverage
32:34,and this is with safety help it's not
32:36,one all walk so he's able to trail and
32:38,he's been doubled throughout this
32:40,ballgame and yet he's still making big
32:42,play that Ryan is 6-4 6-4 96 yards
32:48,want it and run it well Tevin Coleman
32:50,this time Scot with a gain of one you
32:53,look at this running game for the
32:54,Falcons and as I said this is a New
32:57,England defense that has been really
32:59,good in run defense they're only giving
33:01,up just under 90 yards a game and heck
33:05,though Falcons almost have that with
33:07,nine minutes to play in the second
33:09,quarter so this is a defense it's not
33:12,accustomed to teams running the football
33:13,the way that the Falcons have and when
33:15,you're able to do that all the things
33:17,that the Falcons have done well all year
33:18,continues to be in play in the
33:21,play-action stuff and the big shots down
33:23,the field
33:28,second down and nine
33:31,loads too tight in
33:34,for the ball Cheung in coverage
33:38,it's incomplete third down and nine now
33:41,that was that was who were playing
33:43,defense right there
33:44,Patrick Chong he's in a great position
33:45,and when that ball came out it looked at
33:47,me feel like Chung was going to be able
33:49,to make an interception on the ball and
33:52,Hooper's able to get in there break it
33:55,up
33:59,Falcons are easily inside field bill
34:01,range
34:02,kicker
34:05,third down and nine
34:13,enjoy
34:16,the touchdown Austin Hooper
34:20,but a flag is down
34:25,and it's going to be against New England
34:27,the touchdown will stand
34:33,you can see Julio Jones in the oven
34:36,McCarney the safety they're doubling him
34:38,inside out when you do that you go
34:40,one-on-one elsewhere they're afraid
34:42,Austin Hooper is able to beat two
34:44,penalties to crying
34:45,[Applause]
34:48,I'm open on that play looked a little
34:51,bit to me like Hooper might have gotten
34:53,away with something you know on the grab
34:55,too to be able to get inside and make a
34:57,play on that ball
34:59,Lisa rookie Austin Hooper a 19-yard
35:02,touchdown he had three during the
35:03,regular season my knee injury cost him
35:07,the final two games of the regular
35:08,season that he's got a Super Bowl
35:10,touched
35:14,[Applause]
35:17,flag is down and it looked like the
35:20,player Shane McClellan who jumped over
35:22,may have missed timed his leap so Brian
35:26,he was right in Brian's face to the
35:28,point where Mack couldn't even attempt
35:30,the extra point
35:35,here's a call number 58 defense he was
35:39,on the line of scrimmage at the time the
35:41,ball was snapped
35:42,five-yard penalty retried Mike Ferrara
35:46,Paul was in illegal formation against
35:49,the defense I really don't like the call
35:52,although he tries to time the leap if
35:54,he's on the line of scrimmage directly
35:56,over the center then that's an illegal
35:58,formation but he came through over the
36:00,gap and so really to me this is not a
36:03,foul
36:05,what moves the ball up to the 10
36:12,you can see Bill Belichick saying he's
36:14,not on the center he's on the guard
36:17,with maybe a word or two left out
36:19,[Applause]
36:22,well Matt Ryan's playing like a
36:27,superstar and this young Atlanta team
36:33,leads by 14 lead by 14 it's the largest
36:37,deficit in a Brady Belichick Super Bowl
36:40,for the Patriots
36:41,[Applause]
36:43,they playing in their seventh together
36:46,8:48 left in the first half
36:50,the offense was set up at the 25
36:55,coming up it's the Alfa Romeo halftime
36:58,report Tom Brady he's back onto the
37:03,field Kurt Terry Holly Michael and Jimmy
37:05,first-half highlights an analysis and
37:08,the social media check in with Katie
37:10,Nolan now Brady is in a 14-point cold
37:17,the total yards this quarter with 848
37:20,lat
37:29,over the middle the tight-end Bennett
37:31,Houston native has got a first down just
37:34,to add to that step about the largest
37:36,deficit for the Patriots and a Brady
37:38,Belichick Super Bowl no team has ever
37:42,come come back from a two touchdown
37:44,deficit to win a Super Bowl
37:47,ten points is the biggest comeback
37:50,multiple time but this is a 14 to
37:52,nothing game and an impressive start by
37:55,Dan Quinn's Falcons first down
38:07,Pass is short of Edelman and he was
38:10,well-covered
38:13,the way that this Falcons defense has
38:15,been flying around the ball they've done
38:17,a lot of good things and even with that
38:18,being said the the Patriots you know
38:20,they moved the ball that the turnover
38:24,the one turnover in this game is really
38:29,when you look at the offense for the
38:31,Patriots they were rolling then and just
38:33,unable to come away with any points and
38:35,that kind of ignited the Falcons of
38:37,offensively is right there with Dionne
38:39,Jones and Jalen Collins made a similar
38:42,play that kind of got that game
38:45,against the Green Bay Packers in the NFC
38:47,Championship game
38:51,one second down
38:56,Domo and Grady was under pressure yet
38:59,again third and tenth overall they have
39:02,been able to do a good job of getting to
39:04,Brady and they've been able to do it
39:06,without having to start relying on
39:08,bringing extra rushers so with that
39:11,they're able to still play cover it's a
39:13,four-man rush Brooks Reed he's coming
39:15,off the edge and Brady feels the urgency
39:18,to get the ball out they've been able to
39:20,make him uncomfortable
39:21,he's been hit five times sacked twice
39:30,four-man rush Brady fired past pot flag
39:33,is down James White with a cat short of
39:37,first down yardage Brady got hit after
39:40,he let the pass go but flags are down
39:42,with Dwight Freeney and he got home see
39:46,Tom Brady he's England that the penalty
39:48,is against the Falcons
39:55,it's a hold which carries with it an
39:57,automatic first and the pass holding
39:59,number 23 defense
40:03,[Applause]
40:08,offers the hold-hold there in the right
40:12,arm of julian edelman blade free knee he
40:15,put the spin move his patented spin move
40:20,and was able to get a hit on Brady just
40:23,as he was letting go on the ball granny
40:26,with 122 and a half sacks big synthol
40:29,time playing his third Super Bowl
40:32,[Applause]
40:38,to be you stood up at the line of
40:40,scrimmage
40:40,[Applause]
40:43,Milanello former Patriot was in on staff
40:45,with Jonathan Babineaux Rob Gronkowski
40:49,has been out since week 13 with a back
40:51,injury sad surgery he's excited
40:54,obviously when how he feels right now
40:55,going into next year but when the
40:58,Patriots lost Gronkowski they lost a
41:00,major down the middle of the field
41:02,weapon a great player other people
41:04,stepped up Chris Hogan knew about the
41:06,Mitchell but you just don't replace the
41:09,threat of the big Rob Gronkowski and
41:11,what he means to the defense at having
41:14,to defend him they fake the handoff
41:17,gravy gets rid of it - James Wright
41:22,white gets tripped up by Robert Alford
41:24,and a lot of room of Alford doesn't make
41:27,that stop a gain of seven third and
41:29,three coming
41:32,the Falcons defense has done a pretty
41:35,good job of both of these offenses are
41:38,outstanding in yards after the catch but
41:42,for the most part when the Patriots have
41:44,gotten the ball in their hands they've
41:46,been able to come up and make some
41:47,pretty good open good times
41:58,they're down to three
42:07,where the flag was thrown in the
42:09,secondary and it's a hold against
42:12,Atlanta that'll be another New England
42:13,first down prior to the past holding
42:19,number 34 defense
42:20,[Applause]
42:26,he gets caught with the whole grabs a
42:28,face mask on Danny Amendola pretty gets
42:32,hidden right at the end of that play
42:33,come on Drake Campbell he acts like he's
42:36,going to rush and then he backs out he
42:37,comes late seeing Brady had time in the
42:40,pocket but with time it's as we talked
42:44,about with the speed and the quickness
42:45,of these receivers it really stresses
42:49,these defensive backs to first downs by
42:51,penalty on third downs this drop
42:54,[Applause]
43:01,takes it to the 45 a gain of one word
43:03,Tyson Jackson makes the time the
43:06,Patriots have not been a great running
43:09,football team this season the pink there
43:12,excuse me that the Falcons haven't been
43:14,a great run defense you know this season
43:16,and which was going to prevail and this
43:20,first half this Falcons defense has done
43:23,a good job stifling the running game
43:26,with the New England Patriots Dion Lewis
43:28,in the backfield with Brady on second
43:30,and I
43:30,[Applause]
43:42,chrono Allen was right on his back
43:45,anyway but now third and nine
43:47,[Applause]
43:49,Tom Brady
43:51,[Applause]
44:02,[Applause]
44:16,so we're talking about earlier the
44:18,largest comebacks in Super Bowl history
44:19,ten points three times
44:23,the falcons are showing all-out blitz
44:28,third down and nine Brady throws
44:31,incomplete but another flag and it
44:36,happened in the secondary and it's
44:38,another hold against Atlanta
44:47,that's three defensive holds on this
44:50,drive against Atlanta and an easy call
44:53,you see the release there by Malcolm
44:56,Mitchell and then it causes the hold of
44:57,Andre Campbell he just went right
44:59,through Shaq Mason and right guard and
45:01,Brady has to get the ball out but now is
45:03,like you said another
45:06,another one on Brian Poole and whether
45:09,it's been Amendola Hogan or anyone else
45:12,say they've put him in a bind all three
45:15,of those holds and come on third downs
45:22,[Applause]
45:24,Atlanta and Hegeman came through and was
45:27,the first one to greet McGarrett Blanc
45:32,[Applause]
45:34,and the rushing yardage column dominance
45:38,by the Falcons the Eric wants so far
45:42,just two yards of carry eight for 16
45:44,with a fumble
45:45,[Applause]
45:52,45 Green 18 chief Brady
46:00,and he's got a New England first down
46:03,and again Tom Brady just able to get rid
46:07,of it before the pressure got to him
46:10,completes it for 13 March Ellis Bennett
46:13,he comes off the ball and he's able to
46:15,get some separation there and get the
46:17,ball into his hands and he's had to do a
46:20,little bit more with Rob Gronkowski
46:21,going down as well he's bounced around a
46:24,little bit the Patriots give up a fourth
46:26,round pick for him and he's come three
46:30,or so that's a nice place throughout the
46:32,season fake the throw they hand it off
46:35,to Louis
46:37,take it inside the 25 to the 20 for a
46:40,gain of three this is a nice drive right
46:42,now by this Patriots offense been aided
46:45,as we said by some penalties with the
46:47,stock ins defense kept some drives going
46:49,but down 14 points and first half wind
46:53,and down needin to come away with
46:54,something to get a little momentum back
46:55,on their side now they're threatening
46:58,the Falcons won the toss they deferred
47:00,they'll get the ball to start the second
47:02,half second and seven
47:15,for extra yardage third down coming up a
47:18,gain of one and Grady Jarrett is there
47:22,to make the big hit the first guy there
47:24,was Dwight Freeney well I think this
47:27,defensive front for the Falcons was
47:29,really challenged coming in this game
47:31,you see gratings here and I ain't
47:32,halfway expected to see a flag when you
47:34,start body slam and guys you started
47:36,looking for yellow flags coming out but
47:38,they have played really well whether
47:41,it's been getting pressure on Brady with
47:43,a four-man rush or playing the run they
47:46,have risen to the challenge here in this
47:47,first half
47:47,third down and six
47:55,Falcons overload the right side of the
47:57,Patriots offensive line passes Peck
48:00,intercepted Robert Alford he's gone
48:04,there no flags and the Falcons add to
48:07,their lead
48:08,Alford with a pick six
48:34,82 yards on the return by Robert Alford
48:37,trying to run a rubber out with Amendola
48:40,then coming underneath and you're going
48:41,to see Alford he's deep and he just
48:44,reads Brady he drives underneath it he
48:47,makes a play Tom Brady's not able to
48:49,slow him down that's a great job now
48:52,with the Patriots down in scoring
48:53,position with two takeaways defensively
48:56,at this time it's a pick six to 21 left
48:59,in the first half and this young defense
49:04,on the biggest stage
49:08,shutting down Tom Brady
49:11,[Applause]
49:14,two turnovers and they've turned those
49:16,two turnovers into 14 points and lead by
49:21,21 second year head coach Dan Quinn
49:28,it's group up by 21 Dan Quinn the head
49:32,coach of the Atlanta Falcons is in his
49:35,third Super Bowl over the last four
49:37,years two times his defensive
49:39,coordinator for the Seattle Seahawks and
49:42,his young defense is looking Seahawk
49:44,black able to get crushing the floor
49:46,secondary fly-around good active
49:49,linebackers second Dylan seven
49:53,gets hit as he throws it somehow
49:59,unbelievable that ball was up for grabs
50:01,and it drops into the arms of Bennet for
50:04,15 yards Beasley does a nice job of
50:07,coming underneath the block and getting
50:09,a hit on Brady and what typically
50:11,happens on those types of balls that are
50:13,intercepted but Bennet in the perfect
50:16,position to make a play on the ball Wow
50:18,now to Vadra Campbell the rookie
50:20,linebacker is down for Atlanta we'll
50:23,take a break here in Houston
50:28,had to be taken by
50:30,the injury to the bonding
50:32,Devon very candle
50:33,they're left with one Patriots at two
50:38,protection mrs. Julian Edelman who was
50:41,wide open they finally are able to get
50:49,Edelman across the formation and he's
50:51,open a perfectly designed playing and
50:54,Brady just simply misses them this time
50:56,he is afforded a little more time in the
50:58,pocket to deliver the football e white
51:00,greenie who hasn't gotten home yet has
51:03,certainly been the back field a lot he
51:06,has had a heck of the first half and
51:07,they
51:08,it hasn't been lost on the Patriots they
51:11,worked him over pretty good
51:14,ready for for his last ten second and
51:17,ten good protection again
51:21,- receiver his wife nice move for first
51:24,down and more
51:25,inside the 30
51:29,and with a clock running they elect to
51:32,keep their timeouts a 28-yard catch and
51:35,run and one of the few times we've seen
51:37,the falcons over-pursue and unable to
51:39,make the tackle after the catch
51:53,first down from the 29 quick setup
51:58,he's to the 21 Tom Brady has rallied the
52:02,Patriots from a 21-point or more deficit
52:05,to win a game three times in his career
52:08,state channel he's got the Patriots with
52:12,a second down and two
52:13,[Applause]
52:25,third and two with 30 seconds left and
52:27,go back to the catch and run by white
52:30,James white he's in the backfield Deon
52:32,Jones in coverage and gets him running
52:34,and then Jones just not anticipating
52:37,that White's going to get the ball
52:39,thrown to him and not been there to make
52:42,the tackle
52:43,in favor nice game but this is a nice
52:46,Drive here we'll see what the Patriots
52:47,are able to do on third down but trying
52:49,to come away with a touchdown at the
52:50,same time not leave too much time on
52:56,gaining to
53:05,pass is caught first down white
53:08,to the 15 and a timeout taken by the
53:11,Patriots who scored on six of their
53:15,first eight possessions in the AFC title
53:18,game against the Steelers this is their
53:20,sixth drive in this Super Bowl no points
53:23,so far but they're in good position now
53:25,down 21 visit NFL shop calm after the
53:28,game for the largest selection of Super
53:31,Bowl 51 championship gear at the
53:33,official store in the NFL NFL shop calm
53:38,ray has been under a lot of pressure
53:41,against this Falcons defense
53:43,[Applause]
53:46,been predominately with the four-man
53:47,rush and they've been able to get home
53:49,and we start getting hit like that rush
53:52,it has a huge impact then on a
53:54,quarterback
53:57,this is a Falcons defense that last in
54:00,the league keeping people out of the
54:02,endzone down here in the red zone 23
54:05,seconds left in the half first down one
54:08,time
54:10,Patriots show to get on the board Brady
54:12,hangs and finds
54:16,that's one of the stars of this first
54:19,half
54:20,we got his hand in there
54:23,[Music]
54:26,there and the ball was just thrown
54:28,enough behind Edelman to where he
54:30,couldn't catch it on the move because he
54:32,had a couple steps on Robert offered you
54:35,see if he's able to hit him in-stride
54:36,it's a touchdown but Alford with the
54:40,ball slightly thrown behind Edelman he's
54:42,able to make the good play now second
54:44,guy
54:50,a screen for white gets
54:57,inside the five
55:00,12 seconds left and a flag is down
55:02,outside the town
55:03,[Applause]
55:14,there's Martellus Bennett
55:17,holding hold number 88 offense
55:20,[Applause]
55:24,where
55:26,yeah the shoulder pass lifted a campus
55:28,taking them off it's a costly penalty
55:32,David Andrews the center he gets out it
55:34,makes a big time block that springs it
55:37,now it's all coming back and the killer
55:39,is for New England is not only to lose
55:42,the yardage you lose two times
55:47,only 12 seconds left now
55:50,and second and 15 from the 20
55:54,second hold against Bennett listen
56:00,screen for pen
56:03,[Applause]
56:06,clock continues to run and bill
56:08,belichick as you can see is there to
56:10,call a timeout and instead of putting up
56:14,seven before the half it looks like the
56:16,Patriots will have to settle for a
56:18,Gostkowski field goal truck yeah I don't
56:20,know about that call by Josh McDaniels
56:24,you know it was designed well but if you
56:27,get the ball with such little time to
56:29,Martellus Bennett it's unlikely that
56:32,he's going to get it too much out of
56:34,that play so that's one that he'd like
56:39,to have back pretty jarred got in there
56:42,and made that play it'll be a 41-yard
56:45,try by Gostkowski who is 29 of 31
56:49,all-time
56:50,during the postseason and he has hit 20
56:52,straight
57:02,and with two seconds left in the half
57:04,the Patriots are on the poor they travel
57:06,by 18
57:10,not with Tom Brady had in mind that
57:13,drive was knocking on the door the end
57:15,zone Brady is trying to make history
57:18,here tonight become the first
57:20,quarterback to ever win five Super Bowls
57:22,is on the short end of this one in the
57:25,Atlanta Falcons not a lot of believers
57:28,coming into this game especially about
57:30,this defense but man have they played
57:31,great in Troy there was so much talk
57:34,about the New England defense and they
57:37,were the top scoring defense in the NFL
57:39,this year but this is the first time New
57:41,England's defense is facing a
57:44,quarterback been ranked in the top 10 in
57:46,quarterback rating all year and they
57:48,happened to be facing the guy in Matt
57:50,Bryan who ended first with an incredible
57:54,number of 117 point 1 now it's been a
57:56,defense that has been questioned for
57:59,that reason for much of the season in
58:02,terms of who they've played against and
58:05,we certainly knew that this was going to
58:07,be their toughest test and then the
58:09,Falcons have done an excellent job in
58:11,beginning for most people though if you
58:13,de said the score would be 21 3 and a
58:15,half time most everyone would have
58:17,thought that it would have meant the
58:18,Patriots we're the team with 21 points
58:21,this Falcons team both sides of the ball
58:23,they've done an outstanding job and
58:25,really just kind of seems like they've
58:26,been playing in a little different speed
58:27,than what the Patriots have been to the
58:29,credit of head coach Dan Quinn who
58:31,brought his young team to the stadium
58:33,here yesterday let him get inside the
58:35,locker room take their pictures half
58:37,those moments and then as he told us
58:39,during the week one Sunday come this
58:43,time
58:47,and that's the end of the first half as
58:50,its recovered by
58:52,DeMarco
58:56,Falcons had turned two takeaways into 14
59:00,points this opening possession for both
59:04,of these teams I think is big to start
59:06,this second half the Falcons of course
59:08,they want to continue with momentum
59:09,great job to end that half by the
59:11,defense can the offense run the ball to
59:13,play action passing the things they did
59:14,so well there in the first half but more
59:16,importantly and the Patriots defense
59:19,make a stop and let this Falcons offense
59:22,know that they're going to have to
59:23,continue to play and get the ball back
59:25,to this office Kowski kicks it away
59:33,[Applause]
59:35,well covered by New England in a dead
59:37,neuron the stop let's go down to the
59:39,field and check in with Chris Myers Bill
59:41,Belichick said if you wait until
59:42,halftime to maist to make adjustments
59:44,it's too late he started juggling things
59:46,in the opening quarter like how he was
59:48,covering Julio Jones because they
59:50,couldn't stop the run and then when he
59:51,did that Julio Jones set up a touchdown
59:53,when they asked him but House offense to
59:56,get him back in the game I got kind of a
59:57,blank stare but he did indicate turning
60:00,this game around starts who's stopping
60:02,Matt Ryan in the
60:03,one hour 8 minutes since we last saw the
60:07,Atlanta Falcons offense they take over
60:09,at their own 19 leading by 18 and they
60:13,hand it off to Freeman No
60:15,hi towel made the play
60:18,a loss of three and back down to the
60:21,field here's Aaron and Joe you mentioned
60:23,how long it's been for the Falcons
60:25,offense since they've been on the field
60:26,Dan Quinn saying look it is what it is
60:29,and that's why our mindset starting here
60:31,in the second half has to be we're
60:33,pedaling downhill we just have to attack
60:35,did ask him what he told his team reset
60:38,forget about the first half he mentioned
60:40,what concerns in the most this ball
60:42,hulking defense from the Patriots in
60:44,their explosive offense
60:48,Aaron thanks Incan in 13
60:50,[Applause]
60:57,the reception can't make the 25 a good
61:02,play made by Logan Ryan a gain of seven
61:05,so third and six coming an opportunity
61:08,for this Patriots defense to get a stop
61:10,and get Brady right back on the field no
61:13,doubt this would be a big statement by
61:15,this New England defense in PAL Shanahan
61:17,he comes out on first down tries to run
61:20,the ball Dante Hightower makes a great
61:23,play
61:24,on first down and that's something that
61:26,were unable to do with this running game
61:28,by the Falcons they're in that first
61:30,half third down and six
61:44,sideline broken up
61:48,for Taylor Gabriel and out there Eric
61:50,Rowe who was added in a trade week
61:54,wanted the season a former second-round
61:56,pick by Billy there crow he's young at
61:59,the position and like there was a little
62:02,contact at the top of it but they go
62:03,after Eric crow one-on-one and a
62:05,five-man rush by the New England
62:08,Patriots and that's a big time three and
62:10,out that's hard to do against his
62:12,Falcons offense they don't
62:15,rare that they don't pick on the first
62:16,down well it's the first Atlanta Drive
62:18,in this game without a first down
62:20,attached to it
62:23,down at six wash it apart
62:25,[Applause]
62:28,[Music]
62:34,which one temple
62:36,down the sideline
62:38,wotcher
62:40,and a big-time return by Julian Edelman
62:43,34
62:46,56-yard punt here comes New England down
62:49,18 during the break a challenge flag
62:52,thrown by Dan Quinn we're going to get
62:54,the call right now from Carl Jeffers it
62:58,was for that the left foot mentleman
63:00,along the sidelines after review the
63:03,returner stepped out of bounds at the 47
63:06,yard line that's where New England will
63:07,have it first and 10
63:10,dr. 1307 sitting at the 45 of Atlanta I
63:20,assume that tight look it's the 47 of
63:24,Atlanta
63:27,[Applause]
63:28,moving back to the 47 of New England so
63:34,some yardage taken away eight yards on
63:37,the return but Julian Elliman
63:39,and here's a better look at it
63:43,[Music]
63:46,so starting from their own 47 down by 18
63:50,[Applause]
63:59,and said Chris Hogan could throw that
64:01,time by Brady and Hogan couldn't make
64:03,the catch
64:04,collagen coverage good covers by Jalen
64:07,Collins and a lot of field there with
64:09,man coverage to get the ball out on that
64:12,boundary and Chris Hogan just unable to
64:15,make the play on that ball perfectly
64:16,thrown ball by Brady there's two catches
64:19,for 23 yards for Hogan after that
64:22,incredible performance against the
64:24,Steelers in the championship game nine
64:26,for 180
64:27,second and ten
64:34,a flag is thrown from the secondary
64:37,Brian Poole made the stop the undrafted
64:41,rookie out of Florida
64:47,and it's against New England with Brian
64:50,Poole he played that ball awfully well
64:52,guy who had a couple holding penalties -
64:54,interference number 15 offense that
64:56,penalty is declined
65:00,so they decline the penalty instead of
65:02,second in 20s there
65:05,on Chris Hogan but you know Brian Poole
65:08,he's anticipating the quick passing game
65:09,that's one of the things that the
65:10,Patriots like to do in defense that you
65:12,have to be aggressive and attack and
65:14,that's what he was able to do it makes a
65:16,big-time play there down and 12
65:18,for grading
65:28,confusion there about his Falcons
65:30,defense and Dan Quinn on the sidelines
65:33,the head coach called the timeout
65:42,then Quinn's defense
65:46,which is coordinated by Richard Smith
65:48,we'll have a chance to talk about this
65:49,third down and 12 last night all the
65:53,awards were handed out around the NFL D
65:55,NFL's an assistant coach of the year was
65:58,Kyle Shanahan who it appears is headed
66:01,to the 49ers to become their next head
66:04,coach with our former colleague John
66:06,Lynch in the spot of general manager and
66:10,in that little head-to-head against Josh
66:12,McDaniels pal Shanahan's winning that
66:15,battle there he is upstairs
66:19,defense out there and McDaniels trying
66:21,to find a way to get a first down
66:22,[Applause]
66:32,third down and 12
66:34,past
66:38,so despite the great starting field
66:40,position for New England nothing doing
66:45,as soon as they move Edelman down and
66:47,Alford goes with him he's in man
66:48,coverage and Tom Brady knows that and
66:51,this is where the Patriots are really
66:52,dangerous most of the time when you get
66:55,Edelman running the shallow crossing
66:56,routes can't keep up with them with
66:58,tremendous quickness and speed but to
67:00,drop balls there by
67:03,and hope that drive
67:10,and a fair catch called in by women's
67:13,the Falcons have the second time in the
67:16,second half as they leave 21
67:23,rival start for Atlanta at their own 15
67:26,as they lead 21 3
67:31,twenty-one possessions of Falcons went
67:33,three and out that's how they started
67:35,this second half
67:38,but in the backfield
67:41,NASA's Gabriel on across the 30
67:46,Seiler Gabriel who has become a major
67:49,weapon for Matt Ryan game 17 off the
67:54,play-action passing in Taylor Gabriel he
67:56,gets in there and the guy that can
67:59,really fly the fact that he became
68:01,available when the Cleveland Browns let
68:03,him go and Kyle Shanahan had some
68:05,background with him when he was with the
68:07,Browns as offensive coordinator he
68:08,picked him up it
68:10,keya position he is back
68:17,faster :
68:21,Coleman out across the 35 we haven't
68:23,talked much about Alex math who was the
68:26,free agent added from Cleveland to
68:28,really solidify this offensive line he
68:31,got hurt in the NFC Championship game
68:34,there are some reports out there that
68:36,this fibula injury is actually a break
68:39,he didn't really want to talk about it
68:41,much with us
68:43,but he's held up well well sure has he's
68:46,made some quick time blocks to to get
68:48,this running game going
68:49,[Applause]
68:52,Gabriel
68:54,and a bustin coverage by this Patriots
68:57,defense
69:00,Gabriel he puts a heck of a move on this
69:03,round that frees him up Malcom Butler in
69:06,coverage right there trips him up then
69:09,he's got to make the catch no one he's
69:11,got the safety on the other side he's
69:13,going to put the hit on him it's a big
69:18,hand off his to Coleman running left and
69:21,Johnny's here force him out at 35 yarder
69:24,to Taylor Gabriel was the longest pass
69:29,play tonight and here it is again now
69:31,you see the release off the ball with
69:33,speed as soon as he starts to the
69:34,boundary with the dead fake it trips up
69:37,Malcom Butler and it gives Matt Ryan
69:39,just an easy completion but you talked
69:43,about Kyle Shanahan and what he has
69:46,meant to this offense those are the
69:48,kinds of things in terms of grout
69:50,running there's not a lot of teams in
69:51,this league that can really teach some
69:54,of the fundamental thing
69:55,we watch these wide reciever they do an
69:58,excellent job they're parented they're
69:59,well coached that's why they go with the
70:01,football the way they do
70:04,on second and Ryan
70:07,out to his left pearls palaces that's a
70:10,new
70:11,Mohamed Sanu is to the 15-yard line
70:14,Lanta first down about that catch but
70:18,the year for Mohamed Sanu who played
70:21,second fiddle to AJ green in Cincinnati
70:25,now he's second fiddle to this guy he's
70:27,had a great season he really has he's
70:29,over Ruffin his first catch for 13 yards
70:35,Freeman right side hits over
70:38,inside the ten after seven by trade
70:41,flower you think about this second half
70:43,Joe and Falcons open up the second half
70:46,they go three and out the Patriots get a
70:48,great return from Julian Edelman they do
70:49,nothing hood with great field position
70:52,the young Falcons defense force of three
70:54,now and now this Falcons offense on the
70:57,move and threatening for more points
71:00,[Applause]
71:07,and back near the 10 and this Patriots
71:12,defense is looking for a takeaway that's
71:14,what they need a loss of two by Devonta
71:17,Freeman and there's the defensive
71:19,coordinator Matt Patricia
71:22,he's called the defense for Bill
71:24,Belichick since 2010 he's been the
71:26,official defensive coordinator since
71:29,2012 entitled
71:34,Mohamed Sanu down here he's the most
71:37,targeted receiver for this Falcons
71:40,offense on third
71:48,Ryan passe is broken up but a fly
71:53,what luring coverage on Gabriel and a
71:57,flag is thrown right in that spot
72:00,[Applause]
72:09,pass interference number 21 defense
72:11,automatic first down
72:17,and see what happens in the left arm the
72:22,left arm is around him against the pool
72:25,couple it's the penalty there to keep
72:28,this drive alive and then of course the
72:30,big play to Gabriel when he got crossed
72:31,up
72:33,with three catches 76 yards in the game
73:02,this is a this is not what you want to
73:04,see Rob Nika bitch he has the cover
73:07,Coleman as he comes across he gets
73:10,caught up in the traffic as you see he's
73:12,trying to then get out there he gets
73:14,outflanked there's no way you're going
73:16,to be able to make a play on Coleman
73:17,it's a six yard touchdown catch by Tevin
73:20,Coleman
73:22,this to make it 28 to 3
73:25,[Applause]
73:29,not sit through New England snapped
73:33,Atlanta first time they had it in this
73:35,second half not this time down the field
73:37,they go
73:38,Coleman into the end zone Arthur Blank
73:41,loving it up by 25 and Robert Kraft who
73:45,said an unprecedented run of success as
73:48,owner of the New England Patriots with
73:51,his son Jonathan craft to his left our
73:53,right he has never experienced anything
73:55,like this in a Super Bowl
74:00,his eighth as an owner of New England
74:03,Dion Lewis takes a knee that's a superb
74:07,also

74:29,James Baker former Secretary of State
74:31,former Secretary of the Treasury Bob
74:34,McNair on the far right vice president
74:36,Mike Pence in the middle McNair has to
74:38,be thrilled
74:40,his city stepped up with a challenge of
74:42,hosting a Super Bowl his stadiums all
74:45,lit up the hole is deeper for Tom Brady
74:48,in New England underneath passes caught
74:51,Dion Lewis and this offense isn't going
74:54,anywhere right now well we're saying Joe
74:56,really is the speed of this Falcons
74:58,defense and that's what Dan Quinn wanted
75:00,to address when he came in and took over
75:02,as the head coach of this team it was
75:04,the this defense was last in the NFL the
75:08,year before Dan Quinn took over and at
75:10,every position other than defensive
75:11,tackle he'll take speed oversized every
75:14,time and we're seeing guys like dion
75:16,jones were flying all over this field
75:18,and make it place
75:25,second out in seven
75:27,[Applause]
75:30,is messed in a first down for James
75:32,white date of 12 you really can't get
75:40,anything going downfield and that's not
75:42,a typical of New England no chip away
75:45,and just drive it right down your throat
75:47,but not tonight against Atlanta yet yeah
75:49,some self-inflicted punishment too you
75:52,know with the turnovers and we said if
75:54,it Tom Brady three turnovers three
75:56,interceptions in this postseason one
75:58,more than he had all year
76:01,balls and just some uncharacteristic
76:03,things by this patron team
76:06,she's coming because of the turnovers by
76:09,New England is Dion Lewis carries it
76:12,over the right side and picks up eight
76:15,it's a fumble by LeGarrette Blount there
76:18,was an interception return for a
76:20,touchdown by Robert Alford as he picked
76:22,Brady
76:24,and returned in 82 yards to make it 20
76:27,min the first half now second and 2
76:30,[Applause]
76:40,nothing lost a yard third down coming up
76:44,Deon Jones right in the middle of it yet
76:47,again for Atlanta well he's been
76:48,everywhere has it he and they talk about
76:50,Deon Jones and the year that he has had
76:53,and as the middle linebacker that's kind
76:55,of new for him when he got here and he's
76:58,had to be the signal caller and take
77:00,over as the leader and initially that
77:02,was not something he was overly
77:04,comfortable with but his Dave Quinn said
77:06,he began to find his voice as a season
77:09,window for the last month of the season
77:11,he was terrific third down and three
77:13,this is a lateral throw is to Louis
77:19,as the Patriots try little trickery on
77:23,third down and three and now on fourth
77:25,down
77:25,we'll see if Bill Belichick goes for
77:28,know about that play call either now
77:31,they're just trying to create some some
77:33,big playability and maybe catch the
77:37,Falcons off-guard and it looked
77:40,initially like he had a chance to Dion
77:42,Lewis but the ball just not getting
77:44,there fast enough unable to make the
77:46,play and I'm not surprised at all
77:48,they're going for
77:50,46 down by 25
77:58,the man first down big conversion
78:01,Amendola out of bounds inside the 40
78:04,[Applause]
78:06,it's why that play call on third down
78:08,and three I mean you want the ball in
78:10,Brady's hands throwing it not Edelman
78:14,but in this case they convert on fourth
78:16,down with a completion of 17 - Danny
78:19,Amador
78:22,there's three catches for 28 yards
78:25,[Applause]
78:33,bliss quick throw Amendola
78:36,immediately play made by Jalen Collins
78:39,game of to the von Drake ample he was
78:42,coming off the edge in the third what
78:45,those speed rookies that they picked up
78:48,at the linebacker position any of you
78:50,look around this league
78:52,the Falcons possess the fastest
78:54,linebackers in all of football Patriots
78:58,in the first half took it inside the
79:00,Atlanta 35 three times and
79:03,three points
79:06,[Applause]
79:14,second job
79:17,in complaint
79:21,third down and eight with a clock
79:23,stopped in 449 left third quarter just a
79:26,little bit off Joe you watch gravy in
79:29,that first half they were getting some
79:31,pressure on him and really wasn't able
79:33,to settle in that time
79:36,with plenty of time in the pocket and
79:38,just not a very accurate throw and
79:42,that's he's been off just a little bit
79:44,then he's kind of been on the mark
79:45,they've had a few key drops but it just
79:47,hasn't been as it's safe as I'm used to
79:49,seeing from this team
79:55,now third down and eight Brady flush
79:58,down
79:59,[Music]
80:03,20
80:06,he doesn't do it much but that's a
80:08,15-yard carry by Tom Brady and because
80:11,of that then when you're rushing him if
80:13,you tend to lose sight of contained so
80:17,they come underneath they're trying to
80:18,get inside pressure and and Tom
80:20,recognizes it he gets outside looking at
80:22,the throat but once he sees open
80:24,fielding takes it and obviously not a
80:26,guy who runs very often just 28 rushing
80:28,attempts on the regular season but a big
80:32,run there for this
80:33,phaedra defense ties in season game with
80:35,a 15-yard Kent
80:37,[Applause]
80:43,close to the 15 got a meal on the stop
80:49,Neal
80:49,first-round pick from Florida how about
80:52,this helmets are stuck between Martellus
80:55,Bennett and Dwight Freeney and all the
80:59,while the clocks running the clocks been
81:03,running on this drive it's Patriots
81:06,getting a nice drive going but certainly
81:09,time right now is what they're
81:10,contending with as well as points
81:12,[Applause]
81:17,officials reset the play clock but every
81:20,second on the game clock is precious and
81:22,that's been running ever since that
81:25,means Game five
81:29,right sir
81:30,[Applause]
81:31,[Music]
81:32,hang on
81:35,big hit on the tapper wasn't alone out
81:39,there in a carry of ten yards buck wants
81:41,some tough running thereby LeGarrette
81:43,Blount he's trying to
81:46,climb back into this thing and know that
81:48,they got to come away with a touchdown
81:49,on this Drive and all for trying to
81:51,bring down a big man and that's not easy
81:53,to do
81:54,[Applause]
82:05,to the five that's it and I would
82:08,imagine Patriots fans we're saying throw
82:11,the football I mean I they're getting
82:13,yardage with one but we're under two and
82:15,a half left now in the third quarter and
82:18,a lot of time is coming off the clock on
82:20,this Drive you see how much time the
82:22,drive has taken over six minutes right
82:24,now and Dan Quinn is perfectly happy you
82:28,know
82:28,allowing them to drive the football and
82:30,take time off the clock they've done a
82:32,good job not giving a big play
82:33,now they'll throw pass is caught that's
82:36,right
82:37,touchdown
82:45,[Applause]
82:49,rady takes his team into the end zone a
82:51,long drive with 206 left in the third
82:55,quarter first touchdown of the game
82:57,for New England Brian Poole we've seen
83:00,excuse me Taylor Collins that was him on
83:02,the outside
83:04,that's a touchdown and James white he's
83:07,been one of the real positives for this
83:09,offense he's a lead receiver for the
83:10,Patriots in this ball game
83:15,Kowski free extra point
83:20,[Applause]
83:26,the touchdown and Gus Kowski misses the
83:30,extra point that's his fifth miss of the
83:33,seasons and Atlanta's about to get it
83:38,back we'll see how Bill Belichick wants
83:42,to
83:51,that's going to be a penalty flag it
83:53,looked like it hit Gostkowski before at
83:55,110 yards it's recovered by
84:00,anyway
84:01,[Applause]
84:05,but it looked like it hit Gus Kowski
84:06,it's got to travel ten yards untouched
84:11,by the kicking team
84:13,and that's why they threw the flag but
84:16,it's Atlanta's ball anyway the Lord
84:20,Reynolds let's watch and see where this
84:22,comes up
84:26,right

84:33,draw those bodies and get on it

84:57,Virginia has a bull touch on the kicking
84:59,team the ball hit the kicker that

85:02,spot of the recovery first down Atlanta

87:28,far at 158 point 3 12 of 14 193 yards

88:18,interceptions
88:20,[Applause]
88:23,flies good play there
88:25,[Applause]
88:28,and Roberts flowers was in there as well
88:30,Tim and Coleman note game that a flag
88:32,flew early
88:38,holding number 70 offense 10-yard
88:41,penalty repeat second down against left
88:44,tackle Jake Matthews
88:49,this Patriots defense say they've done a
88:51,much better job in the second half
88:52,there's no doubt that Kyle Shanahan
88:54,would like to run the football like they
88:56,did in that first half line this clock
88:58,down but the Patriots have gotten much
89:00,more physical out on the edges yards
89:03,have been harder to come by
89:04,follow up on Matt Ryan yeah I mean right
89:07,from the beginning the guy just he said
89:09,that he'd love this offense and it was
89:11,really a matter of getting comfortable
89:12,with calling the plays there's a lot of
89:15,verbage within the offense and this year
89:18,as the season began he had weapons he
89:21,felt comfortable with what he was doing
89:24,another year in the system and for the
89:26,results speak for themselves and
89:28,congratulations to him on being named
89:30,the league MVP
89:35,Oh welcome you inside our broadcast
89:37,booth and you keep waiting because of
89:40,their history because of his history
89:42,talking about Tom Brady and talking
89:44,about the New England Patriots to jump
89:46,back in this game get a key stop get a
89:48,turnover it's not happening and that's
89:50,in large part to the play of the Atlanta
89:52,Falcons yeah they've really have they
89:53,you know they've grown up as the seasons
89:55,progressed but this is another big step
89:57,against this Patriot team you know in
89:59,this ball game but one of the real key
90:02,turning points I think for the Falcons
90:03,defensively was in the second half when
90:05,Edelman gets the nice return and shuts
90:08,up the Patriots offensively with great
90:09,field position defense forces of three
90:12,big tank stop this Atlanta team has not
90:17,turned the ball over this entire
90:19,postseason in Seattle Green
90:24,gets away from the sack throws that ball
90:26,is
90:28,Austin Hooper England almost forced the
90:33,turnover they were looking for but
90:34,Hooper didn't have it long enough for it
90:37,to be considered a catch
90:39,good job by Matt Ryan to get away from a
90:42,sack from sheer that's ball sheared he's
90:45,the one who came off the corner and Ryan
90:49,he's just trying to get Hooper to to
90:51,throttle that thing that there was a lot
90:53,of field right
90:56,he made it tough on his quarterback
90:58,trying to get him the football with him
91:01,under pressure
91:03,playback Shawn get out
91:09,oh snap
91:12,is sex back on Italy this side of the 15
91:19,mile
91:20,noid an in-season pickup from detroit
91:25,the loss of nine and its fourth down as
91:28,sheared he's able to get home again
91:30,against Ryan Schrader and then van Noy
91:32,that finishes him off and
91:36,then a key stop I mean they make it good
91:39,field position with the mist on sidekick
91:42,defense for the Patriots does a good job
91:44,not surrendering any points on that
91:46,possession
91:46,yeah after
91:48,she said not just the failed onside kick
91:51,the 5-yard penalty
91:53,lake flock down
91:54,[Applause]
92:01,thanks why for delay
92:03,[Music]
92:08,Jeffery's checks with Bill Belichick to
92:11,see the same offense five-yard penalty
92:13,remains fourth down the answer is yes
92:16,meanwhile for Bellatrix defense they
92:18,have three sacks in this game and all
92:20,three have come on third down
92:25,so now three seconds remain in this punt
92:27,would be the last play of quarter number
92:29,three in his 51st Super Bowl
92:39,Edelman waits for it
92:43,whistles of the third quarter and they
92:46,start the game clock and that's it for
92:50,the first three quarters the punt will

96:01,chance once again for a big play down
96:03,the field call has the wheel round you
96:05,see that Edelman he's a couple steps
96:07,there on Brian Poole and just another
96:09,one just unable to connect when the
96:14,opportunity has been there we showed

96:20,offensive snaps in this game I mean it's
96:24,really
96:27,now second and ten past caught Mitchell

96:38,targeted ten times in his game he has
96:41,only three catches and now the Patriots
96:44,they get up to the line but then they're
96:46,spending a lot of time up here getting
96:48,Snapple Roy first down at the 41
96:54,ready from the shotgun Pegasus clock
96:59,pounds is James white they're going to
97:04,give white nearly ten yards
97:08,looks like they stopped in just short so
97:11,it's second and literally inches you
97:13,think this Falcons defenses has done a
97:15,good job in this game of mixing things
97:18,up between some coverage and man
97:20,coverage is trying to keep
97:23,knowing exactly what they're doing on
97:25,every snap Brady
97:28,Pass is incomplete for a module now it's
97:35,third down in two inches is Amendola
97:37,comes away talking to the official
97:43,that's why
97:45,full he gets away with it here
97:47,[Applause]

98:05,[Music]
98:06,inside the 10 by Bennett
98:10,there's life for New England as
98:13,Martellus Bennett is good for 25 time
98:17,brandy knew exactly what he had and
98:18,Martellus Bennett at 275 pounds I mean
98:22,he can run beyond O'Neill he can run as
98:24,well he's the rookie safety but
98:27,Martellus Bennett is able get a steppin
98:34,now first and goal Brady
98:42,Grady jared has his second of the game
98:48,let's see who it was but he drops that
98:51,might be Jonathan Babineaux he drops out
98:53,underneath and that to Grady initially
98:55,thought he's gonna be able to get the
98:56,crossing round and it's not there and
98:57,the time he sees it and gets off of it
99:01,Grady goes down
99:04,and brought the ball back outside the 12
99:06,second and goal
99:17,underneath
99:22,now third down and goal called it a
99:27,little bit earlier Joe when you when you
99:29,watch this deep in just where they swarm
99:31,to the football in the way that they fly
99:32,around eight they do a lot a lot like
99:36,Seattle defense and was the one that
99:39,Dave went coordinated there for a few
99:41,years under Pete Carroll and that's
99:43,that's the template he certainly has got
99:46,some good young players that
99:48,got a nice job in this Bobby
99:52,they're gone and gone
99:59,ladies in trouble again and it's Jared
100:02,yet
100:11,what a night for the second-year pro out
100:13,of Clemson this was the guy who was
100:15,challenged he was going to have to be
100:16,able to play well in this game for this
100:20,balcan steep fence to have a chance and
100:22,he has he comes up big he goes right
100:24,past jack Mason the right guard and he
100:26,gets inside and Grady has no chance
100:31,this is exactly the same distance as an
100:34,extra pike has made this a to score game
100:39,[Applause]
100:41,it's a 16 point game
100:45,Brady Kenan
100:47,into the end zone on that drive the
100:50,Patriots not able to get it into the end
100:52,zone had a first and goal Tom Brady has
100:55,been hit 14 times meanwhile Grady Jared
100:58,the second-year fifth round pick out of
101:01,Clemson had three sacks all regular
101:04,season he's now tied a Super Bowl record
101:08,with his three sacks here against the
101:11,window will pop up kick and back inside
101:14,the 20 it's party on the return
101:16,what is now a to score game to sixteen
101:22,point game disbelief josh mcdaniels back
101:26,to work on offense atlanta it's pretty
101:29,amazing when you look at it and how
101:31,efficient he has been he's only thrown
101:33,the ball 16 times but he has just three
101:36,kick completions so he has been awfully
101:38,efficient not only that this Falcons
101:41,offense only has 33 snaps it's pretty
101:44,amazing
101:45,in an era right now when offenses are
101:48,running 80 and 85 snaps the Patriots
101:51,have twice as many offensive snaps as
101:53,the Falcons
101:55,and into 16.8
101:57,tossed a Coleman
102:00,tackle by Patrick Chung and he was
102:02,trying to rip the ball out during the
102:04,tackle looking to me that's what they
102:07,kind of started this game doing getting
102:10,out on the perimeter and then
102:13,the Patriots tightened up
102:17,that's what Kyle Shanahan this offense
102:19,I'd like to get that running games going
102:21,once again and run this clock down
102:23,Falcons are at six point eight yards for
102:26,Rush
102:26,[Applause]
102:43,- maybe Coleman gun-happy yard at the
102:47,most now kept Evan Coleman is down and
102:51,that stops the clock with 848 left so
102:57,they'll check on their second year
102:58,running back the Tevin Coleman first he
103:02,gets stepped on but that's not the issue
103:04,it's right there on the tackle by Trey
103:06,flowers and they're gonna take Coleman
103:09,in for x-rays
103:12,served in a long one
103:24,out of the shotgun Ryan gets hit wall is
103:28,out this is a fumble by tower not get
103:34,out
103:35,and branch recovers for the Patriots
103:45,a freeman should have picked him up
103:48,he doesn't block him and
103:50,Brian because he's expecting
103:53,Tower to be blocked he's looking the
103:55,opposite way and Hightower makes a
104:00,big-time play right here and hit the
104:02,ball loose on Matt Ryan you see Freeman
104:06,is he reacted when Hightower ran by him
104:11,that is the first Falcons turnover this
104:14,postseason none against Seattle none
104:17,against Green Day big one here under
104:20,eight an event to go 25
104:24,goes down Dwight Freeney delight Frieda
104:30,he's been getting close throughout this
104:33,game and he's going against solder there
104:36,at left tackle and he gets the speed
104:38,rush and this time he gets home his
104:40,first sack since October but he has
104:43,really played well even though it
104:44,wouldn't show up other than that one
104:46,sack he's been applying pressure
104:47,throughout this game
104:51,Lanta Falcons added Dwight Freeney for a
104:54,sack just like that and his third team
104:56,over the last four years in his third
104:59,Super Billy's 36 big player second and
105:02,15
105:07,to squat
105:09,covered by Keanu Neal James white made
105:13,the reception a gain of four third down
105:17,and
105:18,coming
105:21,[Applause]
105:25,this play it's coming right here could
105:27,render
105:30,you wonder down by 16 points with just
105:33,over seven to go
105:36,this is for down territory
105:46,snitch it first
105:50,and it's been the wookie Malcolm
105:52,Mitchell it was really played well in
105:54,the second half yeah after this play
105:55,though Mitchell makes the catch and he
105:57,stops he puts the ball on the ground it
105:59,looked initially like me or to me that
106:01,he was not touched when he comes back to
106:04,make a play on that ball he slams it
106:06,down as though he was in college
106:11,on the 14
106:12,[Applause]
106:17,say that forward progress was stopped
106:20,they keep the game clock running
106:22,Gardo Allen on the tackle and Amendola
106:25,got seven
106:33,[Music]
106:34,[Applause]
106:56,and Grady tells the world they're going
106:58,for two
107:04,a six-yard touchdown for Danny Amendola
107:07,Jalen Collins he's in there play in the
107:09,slot M&E gets caught looking inside
107:11,Amendola just run speed out on him and
107:13,it was uncontested and easy completion
107:16,and touchdown for this Patriots costly
107:19,fumble there on the missed block by
107:21,Devonta Freeman gives the ball the
107:24,Patriots it's a big two-point conversion
107:26,here to really apply the pressure on the
107:28,Falcons they were one for two during the
107:30,regular season on cheap on trucks
107:34,a direct snap
107:37,James white
107:51,- the takeaway
107:53,a one score game in Super Bowl 51
108:00,Lanta led this gave 21 to nothing led 21
108:04,to 3 at the half the biggest lead was 25
108:08,points at 28 to 3 with under two and a
108:10,half left in the third quarter and with
108:13,the turnover and the subsequent
108:15,touchdown this is an eight-point game
108:20,with just under six minutes left and the
108:22,Super Bowl things got a lot tighter a
108:24,fruit across that Falcons sideline
108:27,turnovers in this ballgame for both
108:29,teams to proven very costly another
108:31,[Music]
108:33,if it drives party back inside the five
108:35,that was good work
108:38,perfect kick by Gus Kowski kept it out
108:41,of the end zone
108:42,he made hard he filled it and then the
108:46,Patriots got down field and covered it
108:48,out of bounds at the 10 and with this
108:51,touchdown by Danny Amendola and then the
108:54,two-point conversion Robert Kraft
108:57,Jonathan Crafton
108:59,celebrates
109:01,which Gisele Bundchen mrs. Tom Brady
109:06,mr. Bill Belichick
109:08,first time in a long time there's been
109:10,pressure on this Atlanta
109:13,that's right we'll see what they're able
109:15,to
109:15,here backed up in this crowd is alive
109:21,play-action
109:23,Freeman is wide open no
109:26,and Devonta Freeman makes a move out
109:29,across a 45
109:33,Roberts downfield to make the stop but a
109:36,39 yard catch and run now you're gonna
109:38,see nobody goes with him I couldn't tell
109:40,if it was here in the middle landon
109:43,roberts who should have been going then
109:45,with griemann but clearly a bus there
109:47,man elsewhere and they leave his own
109:49,completely wide open and that Ryan
109:51,exploit
109:52,[Applause]
109:53,longest play from scrimmage in the game
109:58,get to your
110:01,jog in on the stop with jabal shear now
110:07,player is down for Atlanta and this is
110:10,their right tackle Ryan Schrader
110:16,second down and nine
110:20,and over five to play
110:22,[Applause]
110:26,fourth year Pro South Dakota will take
110:28,over first Raider attack later you look
110:32,at a comparison of the two fan bases and
110:35,a history of the championships and
110:39,Atlanta's tired of hearing about
110:41,futility it's been nothing but success
110:43,over the past decade for the four major
110:46,sports franchises in the New England
110:49,area 36 total championships in for
110:52,Atlanta one in 168 seasons of the four
110:58,major sports that belongs to the 1995
111:01,Atlanta Braves here's the injury
111:03,- Schrader
111:10,here in the legs of Syria
111:13,trips Schrader so Compton is in and
111:17,right tackle
111:22,five minutes left second mmm
111:36,extra men on the rush
111:39,steps through it close on the run
111:42,Jones
111:46,by Julio Jones on the sidelines
111:55,no idea how mad ryan gets this ball in
111:58,there and how Julio Jones is able to
112:00,make that catch and keep his feet
112:01,inbounds and secure the football I mean
112:04,that's unbelievable coverage by Eric row
112:07,underneath him and when Matt Ryan broke
112:10,contained I thought he was going to run
112:12,there was just nowhere to put this
112:14,football and yet he finds a spot that
112:17,only Julio Jones can make a play on it's
112:24,a 27 yard completion
112:29,and now it's I'm out on the field
112:31,[Applause]
112:33,that was incredible and considering the
112:36,circumstances with all the momentum with
112:37,New England the biggest catch in this
112:40,second half you're going to see to the
112:41,right of the screen as Matt Ryan takes
112:43,off you know what he's looking at kara
112:48,Crowe is underneath that throw and
112:50,anything short of perfect ball placement
112:53,it's intercepted that's pretty
112:56,incredible stuff right there I mean this
112:58,guy it seems like every time I watch him
113:01,play he comes up with a play that's
113:03,better than the one I've seen previously
113:05,and that's as good as it gets for under
113:07,five minutes the issue is the clock it
113:09,didn't stop he was out of Bounce enough
113:12,for 40 left in the ballgame that was
113:19,grows wondering just what he has to do
113:22,to make the trail
113:25,toss to freamon
113:30,coming up is McCourty on the stop the
113:32,loss of one in a position where a field
113:37,goal makes the task really difficult
113:42,right now a one score game coming up
113:44,the Ford postgame show with Curt Terry
113:46,Holly Michael and Jimmy presentation of
113:49,the Lombardi Trophy interviews from down
113:52,on the field second
114:16,three hours
114:18,[Applause]
114:20,and a timeout is immediately taken by
114:23,New England will tray flowers he goes
114:25,right through Alex back and this is what
114:28,mad Ryan just couldn't afford to do once
114:30,he starts to scramble
114:32,you just can't take the sack there it
114:35,doesn't knock them out in terms of being
114:39,in fill go range but that's a costly
114:42,sack by Matt Ryan it would be a 53-yard
114:46,field goal from this spot Matt Bryan has
114:49,plenty of leg for that but that sack
114:52,makes the field goal try just that much
114:56,more difficult if the Falcons don't come
114:58,up with any yardage on this third and 23
115:01,and then Matt Ryan's got to be smart
115:02,here can't afford another sack trying to
115:04,pick up some yards make it easier for
115:06,Matt grind three points is big right now
115:09,in this ballgame
115:09,[Applause]
115:12,passage parts of new
115:14,that's exactly what happened a flag is
115:18,down back in the area where Matt Bryan
115:20,went down and we'll check the call
115:23,[Applause]
115:25,holding number 70 off
115:30,that's Jake Matthews the third-year
115:34,first round pick out of Texas A&M guilty
115:37,of this hold on Chris long and that is a
115:41,massive call against Atlanta
115:44,and then on the back end of it on the
115:46,tackle of Sinuhe they may have missed a
115:48,face mask really both ways on Sinuhe and
115:55,now the balls back at the 45 and they
115:58,are out of field goal range after the
116:00,hole
116:00,well we'll see what Bill Belichick
116:02,elects to do here because Matt Ryan's
116:04,got the same approach now he just trying
116:06,to get yards get package bill go
116:08,and give yourself a chance
116:12,stopped upfront defensively pass is
116:15,incomplete
116:18,the target and with the sack in the hole
116:21,the Falcons are not in position to add
116:24,to an eight-point lead opportunity
116:28,missed after that incredible catch by
116:30,Julio Jones oh it was such a good Drive
116:32,for Atlanta starting with the completion
116:35,to Devonta Freeman out of the backfield
116:38,and then of course Julio Jones along the
116:40,sidelines looked like okay they're gonna
116:42,you know probably come away with three
116:44,points which makes it awfully difficult
116:46,on the wingmen now they're giving the
116:47,ball back Noah ten
116:49,and they're going to put Tom Brady in
116:51,position to tie this game up
117:02,and over end pun
117:05,inside the ten let's give me a recap the
117:10,season blow 51 come on for the ride
117:13,won't you Austin the hook for the rookie
117:15,tight end with a touchdown that made it
117:18,14 to nothing this
117:19,[Applause]
117:20,interception return
117:27,this was
117:29,the last time the Patriots had in the
117:31,touchdown by Danny and
117:33,Grady Dean's wife punched in a two-point
117:36,conversion it's a one score
117:38,with a touchdown and a successful
117:41,two-point try
117:44,Phil postseason that Super Bowl history
117:50,the leaders at one point
117:52,points for Atlanta they leave by 8:00

118:17,back in on Tom Brady he's had himself a

118:59,one-on-one look and chris hogan make a
119:03,lot of these plays and contacts there at
119:06,the end of it and i like that there was
119:08,no call they let him go after they're
119:10,both trying to make a play on the ball
119:12,third down
119:15,[Applause]
119:35,can't get out of bound strong tackle by
119:37,Collins the big first down
119:41,gain of 16
119:45,tommy's Tom Brady he's hanging in the
119:48,packet and delivers a strike to Chris
119:50,Hogan to convert
119:53,could walk there by James White the
119:55,running back to give Grady just enough
119:57,time Patriots to timeouts
120:01,[Applause]
120:14,coverage by offer
120:16,the target was Edelman 2nd and 10 and
120:19,that was a dangerous pass as he got off
120:29,the bat Ryan sees ball get deflected up
120:31,in the air he's hoping someone can make
120:32,a play on the interception but Alford
120:37,with plenty of contact down the field on
120:39,Julian Edelman Brooks Reid was shaken up
120:41,on that plane
120:43,clock was stopped anyway a 234 and Reid
120:47,has to come out
120:50,second in town
121:01,it goes with it whenever you see all
121:03,four right here go with that man
121:06,already knows immediately there
121:08,he's playing his side if they can run
121:11,some kind of rub ground free selling up
121:12,for big play here shot on Mitchell one
121:17,he's happy and he's out of bounds within
121:20,they're first down this fourth round
121:22,pick out of Georgia grew up in Valdosta
121:26,Georgia fell down got up and made the
121:29,catch what a play he's played well and
121:32,he talked about his season Joe 26 of his
121:36,32 receptions in the regular season came
121:38,in the last seven games and that's when
121:40,they really needed somebody once broke
121:42,Kowski went down and and he became that
121:44,guy
121:54,here's Handelman
121:56,in the pass
121:58,no sign yet
122:02,comes down with a football they're
122:04,saying it's a catch and we'll get
122:08,another look at this
122:09,Alfred knocked it up into the air and
122:11,let's see who comes down with it
122:18,oh that's a catch
122:21,that's incredible
122:25,it's amazing concentration by julian
122:28,edelman to be able to make a play is
122:30,challenging the ruling on the field of a
122:32,completed pass will review the play
122:35,Paul was resting on the arm of Ricardo
122:37,Allen and Edelman able to reap Gravatt
122:40,before he hits the ground
122:41,I checked with Mike Pereira in our booth
122:44,he thinks it's a catch and the plays
122:46,being challenged by Lana and it should
122:48,have been an interception by Robert
122:52,Alford and he makes a play on this he's
122:55,in perfect position right there
122:57,to intercept that ball instead if it's
122:59,popped up but julian edelman top
123:04,standing
123:09,Pereira's in our booth you saw the same
123:11,thing we did do you think it's a catch
123:13,now what I do see is that there is the
123:15,bottle but he gets control and then the
123:18,ball looks like it does touch the ground
123:19,but he had control first so since he had
123:22,control first and then he maintained the
123:25,control
123:26,I think they stay with this as a catch
123:27,and every look we've had makes it look
123:30,like a catch
123:31,makes you think of the Super Bowl at the
123:34,end of the 2007 season which was
123:38,Superbowl 42 when Asante Samuel had a
123:42,shot at an interception
123:44,then the David Tyree catch followed
123:47,Giants eventually won that Super Bowl
123:49,here's Jeffers after review the ruling
123:53,on the field is confirmed
123:54,[Applause]
124:04,a shot at an interception somehow on
124:09,this play Eli Manning stayed upright and
124:12,then throws it downfield and there's
124:14,Rodney Harrison
124:17,who makes the defensive play and time
124:19,Green who catches it against his helmet
124:22,and now this from Edelman
124:25,here's Hammond owner down
124:31,and we are at the two-minute warning
124:34,which will allow everybody including the
124:38,two guys talking throughout on
124:39,to catch their breath minute 57
124:42,[Applause]
124:44,in a season that started with a
124:46,four-game suspension
124:48,Tom Brady is in a position now with the
124:52,ball resting at the 21-yard line of
124:54,Atlanta
124:56,and finish off this conduct but it would
124:58,take a touchdown and a two-point
125:00,conversion
125:02,as he looks for his fifth Super Bowl win
125:07,to feel welcome
125:15,on first down
125:19,right white down inside the ten
125:26,somehow
125:28,is over 400 yards passing in his game
125:32,every cynic a complete
125:36,solo fortune here at 410 it's the second
125:40,most all time
125:42,first again
125:48,from the great
125:51,that's James White what a game he's had
125:53,and white is down to the one been
125:58,working James white when they spread him
126:00,out they last couple times they have him
126:02,in the backfield and he's working
126:03,underneath they've been in that zone
126:04,coverage and Spinneys will see that
126:07,punch it in right here
126:08,[Applause]
126:31,now the biggest two-point attempt in the
126:34,history of the Patriots franchise Marcus
126:37,cannon you see the right tackle he just
126:39,collapses it right there in the double
126:41,team with Martellus Bennett punches it
126:44,in before Campbell's able to make a play
126:48,down here we are a two-point play this
126:50,is it
126:51,[Applause]
126:54,they stomach
126:56,[Applause]
127:07,indication is it's against Atlanta
127:16,this is a tie game
127:21,for two
127:29,he's trying to get a jump on him but he
127:32,goes too fast they get the two-point
127:34,conversion
127:35,tie this thing up and don't ever count
127:38,Tom Brady out best ever best ever in my
127:44,book I said it this week regardless of
127:47,what happened tonight it's the best I've
127:50,seen
127:51,put on a show here in the last 30
127:54,minutes of this ballgame and decline
127:55,back in it you think now for the Atlanta
127:58,Falcons how costly the sack on Matt Ryan
128:03,[Applause]
128:05,tackle Jake Matthews knocks them out of
128:07,field goal range that would have made
128:10,this a two-possession ballgame 2500
128:13,points put up over the last 16 plus
128:16,minutes by New England
128:19,Tom Brady told his owner
128:21,we've seen multiple times in this game
128:24,when he was drafted in the sixth round
128:26,out of Michigan it's the best decision
128:29,that this organization has ever made
128:34,he took over on September 23rd
128:37,2001
128:39,Patriots were coming off of 5 and 11 C's
128:42,in the first year under Belichick and
128:44,Tom Brady after a hit on group let
128:46,Silvano Lewis in a ten to three laws
128:51,took over
128:53,Brady won his first start lost the
128:55,following week talked to the team said
128:58,we're one in three this isn't where we
128:59,want to be follow me and they end up
129:02,winning the Super Bowl as a 14 point
129:04,underdog against Kurt Warner Marshall
129:06,Faulk and the greatest show on turn
129:10,[Applause]
129:11,three more six Super Bowl 50
129:15,[Applause]
129:17,thing on the return for Mary Queens
129:24,the penalty for the offside was enforced
129:26,on the kickoff so the kickoff was from
129:30,the 40 and is Super Bowl 51
129:36,going to be the first overtime game
129:39,in Super Bowl history not at Matt Ryan
129:42,and this highest-scoring off
129:45,in the NFL
129:47,during 2016 has anything to say about
129:50,there's plenty of time with 52 seconds
129:52,left
129:56,at the same time Matt Ryan has to be
129:58,smart with what he's trying to do here
130:03,is
130:05,that's a new
130:08,survive the big hits no timeouts left
130:10,for Atlanta it's a 12-yard gain in a
130:13,first down out to the 23
130:21,extra men
130:24,that's my looper but a short game and a
130:27,clock continues to move Nina for
130:34,no clocking
130:40,[Applause]
130:43,eighteen seconds remain
130:45,I don't like the clock there I think if
130:46,you get them set get them lined up and
130:48,you get the play call a lot of times
130:50,these offenses these days they got one
130:52,word you get guys line up one word tells
130:54,everybody what they're doing you're able
130:56,to get a play off but like you said now
130:58,third down
131:02,with two timeouts a lot can happen in 18
131:05,seconds
131:15,on third and six just four men on the
131:18,rush Ryan guy
131:20,is incomplete
131:26,it ends up in the waiting arms of
131:29,Toronto our man but now it's fourth down
131:31,and here's the pressure
131:36,as flowers almost got home in time Ryan
131:40,really did not want to turn it loose
131:41,when he did but he was forced to because
131:43,of Trey flowers and knowing with the
131:45,clock and how little time was left got
131:47,to get a big chunk he takes a chance
131:51,imagine that they're gonna bring
131:53,everybody here try to make a play on
131:55,this pot
131:58,eleven seconds left in regulation
132:01,[Applause]
132:03,taken by New England
132:08,bill belichick
132:10,has seen his team put up 25 unanswered
132:13,points
132:15,to tie this game at 28 and even with the
132:19,missed extra point earlier they're able
132:21,to convert twice on two point tries
132:23,[Applause]
132:25,this is just shocking
132:32,you okay over there shock it others
132:36,alert yeah this police
132:42,time outs taken by New England here just
132:44,to make sure that the feet of Darren
132:48,Harmon did come down out of bounds and
132:51,he was out of bounds so
132:55,belcheck called that timeout to make
132:57,sure that the boots would have time to
132:58,maybe review it and we're in a booth
133:00,review as we're inside of two minutes
133:05,[Applause]
133:10,after review the ruling on the field is
133:13,confirmed it's an incomplete pass fourth
133:15,down
133:20,now to punt by bocher and what
133:23,once is obviously a good snap and Josh
133:26,Harris
133:29,and see what posture can do he will not
133:31,take his time
133:32,[Applause]
133:42,and fair catch by Edelman at the 35 and
133:46,there are three seconds left the end of
133:51,that play
133:52,[Applause]
133:54,six-time Pro Bowler Matthew Slater got
133:56,dropped to the turf
133:59,no penalty flag and Julio Jones is going
134:02,to come in and he'll be one of the deep
134:03,man
134:06,as we'll see what Tom Brady and the
134:07,Patriots want to do do they want to
134:09,heave it hope for a penalty get a shot
134:11,out of
134:12,or just be content with the first
134:15,overtime game in Super Bowl history 250
134:19,of these things to find an overtime game
134:23,sure seems like we're headed
134:26,into extra time you think about the
134:30,Falcons I mean it you say shocking
134:31,disbelief all felt all those words in
134:34,them and that's what the Falcons you've
134:35,got to be thinking over there they got
134:36,him
134:39,Brady
134:40,[Applause]
134:43,it's Dion Lewis with just a little
134:45,excitement before the end of regulation
134:49,this don't the Dion Lewis is okay
134:52,down hard on the turf at his own bench
134:55,and maybe the answer that question is no
134:59,yeah booth since he went to the ground
135:03,watch how he hits the turf
135:07,stuck his leg into the ground
135:10,down as hard as he did
135:13,[Applause]
135:14,right there looks like a lower-body
135:18,I'll say it again alkanes lit this game
135:21,21 to nothing at the beginning as they
135:24,made their way through the early parts
135:27,of this game 21 to 3 at the half the
135:30,biggest lead was 25 points at 28 to 3
135:33,with under two and a half minutes left
135:35,in the third quarter and the Patriots
135:40,and tied it to touchdowns into two-point
135:43,conversions at work
135:45,[Applause]
135:46,in an overtime period that will continue
135:49,until the winter is determined it is
135:50,sudden-death unless the first team to
135:52,possess kicks a field goal in which case
135:54,the other team will have an offer
135:56,every team gets three Steve gets three
135:59,timeouts we basically begin a new game
136:01,as far as timing goes and all the replay
136:03,challenges will be initiated by the
136:05,replay official in the booth
136:07,this is heads this is tails
136:10,New England gets to call the toss it
136:12,they have called heads
136:16,it is heads

137:11,touchdown the game is over
137:15,experience the game like never before
137:18,from every angle key play on that drive
137:23,was the throw to Danny Amanda
137:31,and the touchdown
137:35,it was James white Danny Amendola the
137:38,two-point conversion and we're tied at
137:40,28 yeah this is a Falcons defense at
137:42,they're reelin this second half when you
137:44,look at what the Patriots have done
137:45,offensively they scored the last four
137:47,times they hated the ball
137:48,[Applause]
137:56,trying to tiptoe beyond Jones on the
137:58,stop white just turned 25 fourth round
138:03,pick out of Wisconsin two years ago he's
138:06,had a big game sure has been
138:11,the Bradys
138:14,go-to-guy here in this ballgame their
138:16,team catches 113 yards
138:21,one huge touchdown
138:25,granny in this fourth quarter
138:26,[Applause]
138:37,on the reception
138:39,one of the best in the game for Tom
138:41,Brady you called it you got to lay this
138:43,ball out on the sideline Amendola again
138:46,with the speed out Brian Poole and
138:48,coverage and Brady lays it out perfectly
138:52,balls just dropped right in 14 yard
138:56,completion and at first end at their own
138:58,45 mile blink
138:59,[Applause]
139:17,chris hogan has had a quiet game but a
139:19,big catch for 18 and time in the pocket
139:22,for tom brady you're going to see chris
139:24,hogan at the end of this as he works
139:25,back through the ball he's able to work
139:29,back through to the quarterback and make
139:31,a play with Jalen Collins then in
139:34,coverage but
139:36,Tom Brady on the last two throws has had
139:38,a clean pocket he's delivered perfect
139:40,balls
139:40,[Applause]
139:56,perfect play by the wookie Deon Jones
139:59,and if Tom Brady doesn't use his best
140:02,fastball that's a dangerous pass out
140:06,there to white who was waiting for it
140:08,from Brady tried that a couple times and
140:10,then the Falcons have been aggressive on
140:12,that quick throw James waiting out with
140:17,14 catches that's a new Super Bowl
140:18,record a loss of three second and 13
140:32,masses
140:34,Julian Edelman
140:38,first down at the 25 to see this
140:41,offensive line there they're doing a
140:44,good job right now of giving a clean
140:46,pocket inside for Brady with no pressure
140:49,and then Brady he allows Julian Edelman
140:51,he's in man coverage alter it is on him
140:54,but he's got to clear a free guy and
140:56,with protection Brady is able to hang on
140:59,to it and again makes a good throw the
141:01,Patriots win Super Bowl 51 with a
141:03,touchdown right here
141:05,Lana gets to possess fake it to Hogan
141:12,looking for blocks getting blogs inside
141:14,the 20
141:24,and it's a first down
141:27,this is really well executed by the
141:31,Patriots they get linemen out right
141:33,guard shack Mason he gets a man on the
141:36,ground Julian Edelman he's blocking out
141:39,in front
141:45,can somebody step up a big club
141:55,first
141:57,here's flag too strong
142:01,Martellus Bennett ride on the under
142:04,thrown ball for a spinning catch and a
142:06,flag is thrown right in the spot where
142:10,Bennett came down to von Drake Campbell
142:12,and coverage we'll see if it's against
142:15,number 59 now they're gonna get Campbell
142:17,for the pass interference I think it's
142:19,the right call the ball that was a
142:21,little under thrown but Campbell never
142:23,is able to get turned around to make a
142:24,play
142:34,it's going to set up first and goal from
142:36,the two
142:40,checks in
142:43,we rushed for a league-high 18
142:45,touchdowns during the regular season has
142:48,19 when you include the postseason a
142:52,touchdown here
142:55,any great it's a Patriots win when they
142:57,got the big fullback James Devlin
142:58,leading the way
142:59,[Applause]
143:07,and Beasley got his left hand on a
143:12,dangerous throw and that's the play the
143:15,Falcons have been waiting for almost got
143:17,it
143:18,Beasley played it pretty well he was in
143:19,position and he's knocking it down but
143:22,boy when the ball went up I'm like you
143:24,Jonathan that's a risky pass by bradying
143:28,but Beasley had a chance to make the key
143:32,takeaway that they're looking for down
143:34,here the great Tom Brady had completed
143:36,tenure on second and goal
143:38,319
143:39,[Applause]

144:12,driving
144:18,they've already shot off the confetti
144:19,fans are on the field
144:27,and it looks like a good touch and it
144:28,does to me to Joe when the knee goes
144:31,down where's the ball what they do if
144:34,they had to overturn this but it looked
144:36,to me like the ball was across and what
144:40,an effort by James White who's had
144:42,himself a heck of a ballgame there was
144:44,contact by Ricardo Allen and yet he's
144:46,out able to get across the goal line
144:48,what a game by the New England Patriots
144:51,and Tom Brady
144:54,3428 the final in overtime and the
144:57,Patriots agreed to find the word
144:58,momentum here tonight
