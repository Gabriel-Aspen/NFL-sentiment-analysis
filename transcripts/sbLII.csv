time,transcript
0:00,two weeks of hype and as the great John
00:02,Madden used to say it's time for a game
00:05,to break out and not soon enough
00:08,New England kicking off they won the
00:12,toss they have deferred so we'll see the
00:15,Philadelphia offense
00:16,you've got Warner and Clement back deep
00:21,Tom Brady over on the sideline Foles
00:25,will go right to work after the kickoff
00:32,in Minnesota here we go on a line drive
00:34,kick fielded by Clement at the one-yard
00:37,line to the outside he goes and he gets
00:41,run on the bounds by Patrick Shug up at
00:44,the 25-yard line
00:46,what a story for Nick Falls what have
00:48,you been reading about it hearing about
00:50,it over the last month or so took over
00:51,when Carson Wentz got hurt
00:53,what an odyssey but during the
00:55,postseason he has been tremendous
00:57,started his career with Philadelphia
00:59,went to the Rams after his release spent
01:02,last year as the backup to Alex Smith
01:05,and Kansas City and then came here
01:10,LeGarrette Blount starts in the
01:13,backfield they have three good running
01:15,backs
01:17,Burt's repositions and sets up on the
01:19,slot to the right they go right to the
01:21,air and the pass is caught by Nelson
01:24,galore bringing a file up to the 30-yard
01:26,line tackle their bike I love van Noy
01:29,just a little zone defense to start
01:32,things off for a galore and I love what
01:36,Doug Peterson did instead of coming out
01:39,and being cautious letting Nick Foles
01:42,come out and just get settled with a run
01:44,play come out throw it right away
01:46,get him in the game Matt Patricia who
01:48,will be named head coach of the Detroit
01:50,Lions in a couple of days was on the
01:52,left
01:53,Blount is the back and again a passive
01:55,here is caught by angle or falls into
01:58,the championship game by completing his
02:02,last 15 in a row so that 17th straight
02:05,yeah and you know he seems so confident
02:09,in the AL it did not seem too big he
02:12,played great in the championship game
02:14,I thought his vision has focused down
02:17,the field some of the scrambles in the
02:19,pocket were tremendous and you can look
02:22,at that during the regular season not
02:24,very good in postseason tremendous
02:27,postseason the two games against
02:30,Atlanta and Minnesota from the 32 third
02:33,down and four
02:38,Bulls flush that keeps his eyes
02:41,downfield and completes it to ask John
02:43,Jeffery first you were the Eagles came
02:45,over from the Bears and Philadelphia
02:47,with the game's first first down now
02:52,Sean Jeffrey who's been coming up big is
02:55,going to come in Luke back out here and
02:57,because the Patriots had an inside stunt
03:00,that allowed Nick Foles to scramble just
03:02,a bit to his left by that extra time
03:05,[Applause]
03:08,Jeffrey had nine touchdown receptions
03:11,during the regular season from the 49
03:17,is their first running flood it's blunt
03:19,and he will get stuffed by Kyle van Noy
03:22,what looking for his second Super Bowl
03:24,ring in a row won it with New England
03:26,last year and then came over to
03:28,Philadelphia in the offseason how about
03:30,this play by Kyle van Noy just hammering
03:33,off the edge this is exactly where
03:35,they're trying to get the run game going
03:36,you can see the reduced look inside off
03:39,tackle runs are going to be huge but if
03:42,Kyle van Noy plays like that all night
03:44,you can forget that option loss of two
03:47,they have got Jay a jockey who was
03:49,picked up in midseason from Miami he's
03:52,in the backfield
03:53,and here's the first of the run pass
03:55,options the RPO zz's
03:58,these days in the past is incomplete at
04:02,the 38 yard line Torrey Smith could not
04:05,hold it in its third down at 12 to the
04:07,Eagles now for duck Peterson he is not
04:11,going to get beat tonight because he's
04:13,afraid because he's nervous about his
04:15,quarterback we saw it in the
04:17,championship game he is going to dial up
04:20,some shots and we also know from Nick
04:22,Foles that he likes that style he does
04:25,not want to apologize to Bill Belichick
04:27,or anybody he's coming out firing
04:31,third and 12
04:39,fools deep in the pockets fire staff
04:43,that is hold in at the 38 yard line by
04:46,Torrey Smith the former Raven former
04:49,49er tackle there by Eric Rowe a former
04:52,Eagle Deena 15 you need some time for
04:54,this one watch the center here Jason
04:56,Kelsey it looks like he's going to get
04:58,beat on this stunt he recovers just in
05:00,time to allow foals to make the turn and
05:02,pick up that first down
05:06,Kelsey one of the better athletes that
05:09,you will find play in that center
05:10,position nice catch
05:13,I think he is the best Center in the
05:16,league the junkie in the backfield from
05:20,the 38 yard line
05:22,in the RPO and the pass is caught by
05:25,hertz
05:26,the titan he was their leading receiver
05:28,during the regular season cost 74 and
05:31,that eight touchdowns yeah they caught
05:33,Calvin Oy in a coverage where he was
05:35,going to drop back over the middle and
05:37,that time Nick Foles who seems to have
05:40,his eyes working out here you know
05:43,sometimes out early in a Super Bowl
05:44,early in a real pressure situation for
05:47,the quarterback you don't quite get that
05:49,focus going but we saw in the
05:50,championship game and what a drive he's
05:52,putting together here and there's Carson
05:54,Wentz who might have been the MVP had he
05:55,stayed healthy heard against the Rams in
05:58,December and that got foals into the
06:00,lineup second down and three this time
06:02,they handed to a jockey on an inside run
06:05,a giant picks up a ton of yardage after
06:08,contact as those Blount and a giant kind
06:11,of worked his way out of Miami there was
06:13,a lot of Thurman drying down there we
06:17,were there in midseason and you know he
06:20,has a different idea as to why he was
06:21,released the Dolphins will tell you
06:24,another thing but Philadelphia thrilled
06:26,to have al he is a violent runner he is
06:29,a violent finisher he is the guy that is
06:33,on the other half of that RPO if he gets
06:34,going to the outside this offense is
06:37,going to work opening drive of the game
06:40,he goes and he gets tripped up and
06:44,tackled the 21 that's Vannoy already off
06:47,to a great start
06:48,who makes the tackle gain of six second
06:50,down and four so interesting to watch
06:52,these RPO plays you'll see the defense
06:54,basically split these people going here
06:57,they're going there and it leaves a big
06:58,gap right up the middle once again Jason
07:02,Kelsey out front with a key block
07:05,Patriots 29th and yardage allowed
07:08,defensively so that was bad points
07:10,allowed only fifth-wheel sang they've
07:13,been my break and they've been great in
07:15,the red zone second down and four little
07:18,flip out here to Corey Clement make
07:21,lemon gets inside the tenant system a
07:23,first down and goal plummet rookie out
07:26,of Wisconsin undrafted
07:33,once again the stunt catching up you see
07:35,the Patriots looping inside so the
07:38,perfect play call there by Doug Peterson
07:40,and these screens have been fantastic
07:44,not just for Nick Foles but for the
07:46,Eagles throughout the course of these
07:47,playoffs
07:49,[Applause]
07:50,Chris lawn reacting as he takes a look
07:53,at the big screen here comes the 11th
07:56,play of the drive
08:04,to the one-yard line he goes Lorenz guy
08:09,makes the tackle there now this is some
08:14,impressive start isn't it beautiful
08:16,I'm total feel you've got a wonder over
08:18,there Bill Belichick and Matt Patricia
08:20,are probably thinking oh that's
08:21,fantastic give them the ball first won't
08:24,get at the start the second half
08:26,Nick Foles is going to be nervous not
08:28,yet
08:29,Patricia that familiar red vest
08:33,Blunt is the running back
08:35,he already has 10 postseason touchdowns
08:38,in his career and I've got our first
08:40,whistles the Jean starett or we'll take
08:42,the mic for the first time tonight
08:45,number 86
08:50,Zach Ertz the tight end making it second
08:53,down a goal you know al how many times
08:55,have we talked about this Patriots
08:57,defense this year they are the classic
09:00,bin don't break you will always pile up
09:03,a lot of yards against Matt Patricia's
09:05,defense but scoring touchdowns it's a
09:08,different story
09:10,they allowed only six rushing touchdowns
09:13,all season second fewest in the league
09:20,fake toss falls goes the other way and
09:23,throws that out of the back of the
09:24,endzone maggle or the closest to it and
09:27,it will be third down and goal just
09:30,talking about that Patriot defense and
09:33,how good they have been in the red zone
09:36,fourth and touchdown percentage first
09:38,and takeaways points allowed only 3.9
09:42,second best in the league's and they
09:44,give up a ton of yardage a lot of it
09:46,early in the season then they got it
09:48,together and they're very tough down
09:50,here third and goal yeah and now you
09:52,have to start watching the tight in Zach
09:55,Ertz and you watch out Sean Jeffrey Lee
09:57,love those little skinny posts in the
09:59,back the end zone thrown up high
10:05,off play action to the back of the
10:08,endzone and broken up there by row now
10:12,Sean Jeffrey the intended receiver and
10:14,it's interesting that row got the start
10:15,instead of Malcom Butler tonight still
10:18,have to settle for a field goal attempt
10:20,well I think you're gonna recognize this
10:23,name James Harrison coming off the edge
10:26,in no way in the world you're going to
10:28,get a back a giant to come out there and
10:30,make that play and then here's roe on
10:32,the back end they try to get it up high
10:34,let him jump ball but roe got just
10:36,enough of them to not allow that jump to
10:39,take place good stand there by the
10:40,Patriots Jake Elliott a rookie had to
10:43,get him early in the season and Caleb
10:44,Sturgis to hurt opening day
10:47,your art attempt is good so they go from
10:50,the north 26 into field goal range 14
10:53,plays and fill it leads three nothing
10:58,the Hall of Fame class Randy Mawson the
11:02,old Eagle Brian Dawkins already thrilled
11:05,about that Ray Lewis is Bobby better and
11:07,congratulations to him spectacular
11:09,career as a general manager down the
11:12,line we go the brand new hall of fame
11:14,class for 2018 so the Eagles had the
11:19,ball for almost half the quarter and now
11:22,a touch back here as the on Lewis makes
11:25,a name
11:27,wrong with that pass breakup let me come
11:30,back radiant company going to work
11:33,[Music]
11:36,those records figured to stand for a
11:39,long time first of all how many
11:40,quarterbacks are going to get to play in
11:41,eight Super Bowl games two passes
11:43,completions yards touchdowns he owns all
11:47,of those for Brady five and two in his
11:52,seven Super Bowls his first play tonight
11:55,from the 25-yard line they start with a
11:57,fullback Devlin along with Lewis in the
12:01,backfield play-action slip it to the
12:04,other side and Brandon cooks incomplete
12:08,bouncing ball second down and ten of
12:11,course Tom Brady 17 days ago that
12:13,collision with Rex Burkhead
12:16,in practice and the gushing cut he wore
12:20,that tape during the championship game
12:22,but not tonight Chris now he said he was
12:25,ready to go with it might stick a little
12:26,glue on there just to toughen up that
12:28,hand he had a pat on it in the last game
12:31,and he felt like that messed with his
12:33,grip a little bit on the football so
12:35,[Applause]
12:37,no tape nothing got used to it by the
12:39,fourth quarter though rainy throws and
12:43,that'll be caught and that is jeans
12:44,white what a tremendous day in the Super
12:47,Bowl last year is run out by Jenkins and
12:50,that'll be a first down the gain of 15
12:52,yards yeah it's kind of interesting to
12:54,see that Jenkins is going to be on white
12:56,watch this in-and-out route here it is
12:58,the quickness of the New England
13:00,Patriots at the wide receiver position
13:02,that has taken them in many ways to so
13:04,many of these championships to the line
13:06,quickly set up a screen but a flag is
13:09,down that's James white making the grab
13:13,might have been 12 guys on the defense
13:17,that seems to be the initial call from
13:20,Jean Stewart or Brady's so good at
13:21,creating those situations
13:27,[Applause]
13:33,well if there's one guy that knows all
13:37,about Bill Belichick and what he likes
13:39,to do it's that guy right there Jim
13:41,Schwartz he basically got his first job
13:44,with Bill Belichick in Cleveland and he
13:47,was offered an unbelievable deal he got
13:48,to work a hundred hours a week for no
13:51,pay and brought coffee to the secretary
13:54,the truck went shopping for the
13:55,secretaries that they were to important
13:57,trips to the riot on first down and five
14:00,Lois is the running back
14:03,play action good protection wide open
14:06,Chris Hogan who gets inside the 30 takes
14:09,them all down to the Philadelphia 27
14:12,yard line and Dolan with a great block
14:15,and Grady's gonna take them right up to
14:17,the line after a gain of 28 yeah and
14:20,this is going to be an issue I think
14:22,tonight for the Philadelphia Eagles this
14:25,is a team that lost their signal caller
14:28,and Jordan Hicks can they keep up with
14:30,the pace of Tom Brady and around give it
14:34,the Hogan just made that last catch and
14:36,they get spun out of bounds at about the
14:38,23 by Jalen Mills how about Rob
14:42,Gronkowski you think he's back from the
14:44,concussion check this one out go by
14:48,welcome welcome to the Super Bowl
14:51,rookie Derek Barnett got hurt yeah I got
14:54,hurt against Jacksonville it didn't pass
14:56,the concussion protocol until this week
14:59,at the 14 days off Lewis and the
15:04,full-back Devlin in the backfield on
15:05,second down six six and a half minutes
15:08,to go and
15:09,it'll count top three nothing great he's
15:12,finest over the middle caught at the 14
15:14,yard line
15:15,Rob Gronkowski led the team in caches
15:18,this season Rodney McCloud makes the
15:20,stop first down to England play-action
15:23,an issue you put the big pullback in
15:25,James Devlin
15:27,and the middle linebacker reacts and
15:29,they get in behind him that is going to
15:32,be a problem this defense especially
15:34,this one defense of Philadelphia is
15:36,predicated on those linebackers coming
15:39,down hard and making plays in the run
15:41,game very susceptible to play action he
15:43,split the fullback Devlin out this time
15:45,got white in the backfield
15:49,why cause 56 passes this season
15:53,and set the condom and
15:56,yard line is he's able to hold it in
15:59,there white had 20 points in the Super
16:02,Bowl last year three touchdowns and put
16:04,it in the game winner and overtime in a
16:05,two-point conversion there's Josh
16:07,McDaniels offensive coordinator in a
16:09,couple of days he will be the head coach
16:11,of the Indianapolis Colts yeah James
16:12,White has more receptions out of the
16:15,backfield than all the Eagles running
16:17,backs combined Eagles defense six drives
16:21,only one touchdown allowed Patriots have
16:23,gotten into the end zone eight times
16:26,in nine and this is white stopped at the
16:29,line of scrimmage by nigel Bradham
16:31,making it third down yeah now we come
16:36,down to it same situation right both
16:38,teams go up and down the field here are
16:41,the Patriots now with a third down
16:43,inside the 10 yard line can they convert
16:46,they've run seven plays two runs five
16:49,passes
16:54,Gronkowski split out wide that's your
16:57,first option if in fact he doesn't get
16:59,help maybe leaning that way a bit now
17:01,third and four when they send white into
17:05,the slide ready looks that way then
17:08,fires over the minute broken up at the
17:10,goal line Jalen Mills intended for
17:13,Gronkowski and his fourth down
17:15,yeah Brady got away with one there that
17:17,ball was well behind Gronkowski coming
17:20,on the slant coming across the middle
17:21,and Mills I think if he had been able to
17:24,get in front just a bit with his other
17:26,hand might have had an interception
17:27,right there a break for the Patriots
17:30,Stephen gets a ski in his 12th year in
17:33,the league where they had a pair back to
17:36,back end up into Terry there for so long
17:37,it's costing a dozen seasons 26 yard to
17:42,town
17:43,Ryan Allen to put it down and the two
17:47,teams with similar opening drives each
17:49,ending with field goals 3-3 Super Bowl
17:52,52
17:54,Super Bowl 1 you could have gotten into
17:57,that game for 12 bucks Robert Kraft it's
18:01,the ninth time his team has been to the
18:03,Super Bowl but there once before Brady
18:05,and Belichick Jeff flurry watched his
18:08,team in 2004 lose in Jacksonville you
18:12,did the game on Fox to New England was
18:16,exciting game then as well
18:18,his bear fact that first Super Bowl for
18:20,12 bucks he spent 24 bucks on that one
18:24,didn't guy did 49 yard line signals
18:27,perfect
18:30,Kozlowski to kickoff
18:34,[Applause]
18:36,[Music]
18:37,this is returnable two
18:41,to the oil
18:43,barter back up to the 24 we used to call
18:47,off the run pass option but now in the
18:49,vernacular Orfeo yeah and basically all
18:53,it means is the quarterback has the
18:54,option he's going to look at a
18:56,linebacker or a safety or somebody and
18:59,they have gone to that and basically
19:01,decided that Nick polls is just so much
19:05,better running that offense than what he
19:08,was before so during the bye week he was
19:10,able to make the conversion and we see
19:12,the Patriots they've struggled a bit
19:13,against them so Foles going to work here
19:17,starts the game six of nine for 61 yards
19:21,the Peterson in the second year as the
19:23,Eagles coach and he calls the play
19:25,cinnamon twofold
19:29,and that is quite and staying on his
19:31,feet and picking up some extra yards
19:33,about eight total is Nelson a galore had
19:36,two pretty mediocre seasons and then had
19:38,a breakout year this year say what about
19:41,that action after the catch and made
19:44,somebody missed this team in general is
19:47,very good at breaking tackles after the
19:50,catch
19:51,and there goes James Harrison back in
19:54,coverage he's going to take a big shot
19:57,and miss the much shifty er Nelson
20:00,Aguilar Harrison 39 years old oldest
20:02,defensive player in league long time
20:05,Pittsburgh Steeler
20:06,[Applause]
20:09,one over the right side breaks free in
20:13,the patriot territory and spun down at
20:16,the 33 yard line by Dharana harmon the
20:22,former Patriot walked to the races for
20:24,36 yards big guys right up here this is
20:27,the strength of the offensive line for
20:29,the Philadelphia Eagles on that right
20:31,side
20:32,nice job by Wisniewski as well coming
20:34,down and four LeGarrette Blount how much
20:36,do you think he enjoyed that particular
20:38,run he was asked to take a bit of a pay
20:41,cut if he wanted to stay in New England
20:42,he said no thanks I'll take my shot to
20:45,beat you in Philadelphia and there's
20:47,Brandon Graham saluting him from the
20:49,Eagles sideline ball at the 34
20:53,[Applause]
20:59,play action going for it all into the
21:02,endzone
21:06,I'll charge it free for the touchdown
21:12,he beats Eric bro made the big play on
21:15,the first drive to hold him to a field
21:17,goal but not this time
21:18,the former bear 34 yards in a touchdown
21:20,and Nick Foles told us he said early in
21:24,this game I want to be able to take my
21:26,shot and there goes his big guy as we
21:29,have seen these Philadelphia Eagles have
21:32,a way of playing above the rim you watch
21:35,these receivers come on the field you
21:37,think you're getting ready to watch an
21:38,NBA game they go up box out rebound and
21:42,they've been putting points on the board
21:44,with that formula all season long
21:46,they're being scoring play of course
21:47,gets reviewed looks pretty good to us
21:49,from this point
21:52,as they check it out you know the phrase
21:55,these days can you survive the ground
21:57,can any of us survive
22:01,not the underside
22:03,[Applause]
22:05,here we go here we go
22:08,starett or say it's confirmed so if
22:12,putting it with the game's first
22:13,touchdown and Elliott now for the extra
22:16,point
22:20,Jones puts it down and that kick is low
22:25,he missed it once more the foals pass
22:31,into the end zone but they missed the
22:33,extra point and it's 9 to 3
22:42,music's biggest moment of the year the
22:45,Pepsi Super Bowl 50 du halftime show
22:47,featuring Justin Timberlake who released
22:50,his new album man of the woods this
22:52,weekend getting ready to perform at US
22:55,Bank Stadium in Minneapolis as you look
22:57,at downtown Minnie on this frigid Sunday
23:01,night oh please
23:03,hashtag that it's taken over the world
23:05,by everywhere it's everywhere you

23:10,show I'm just telling you right now your
23:13,hashtag has flown around the world and
23:16,back 25 times that is a career-ender
23:19,telling you right now
23:25,on yard-line Dion Lewis
23:28,they'll bring it back to the
23:33,is he man down for the Patriots at the
23:37,25-yard line
23:39,chef flurry exalted along the
23:42,Bradley Cooper
23:47,so brainy goes to work second possession
23:53,Louis is the tailback
23:58,we're the minnow breaks a tackle and
24:00,picks up about eight yards getting to
24:02,the 26 yard line well one of the things
24:06,you have to do is slow down the pass
24:08,rush of this team one of the great ones
24:10,Fletcher Cox right there they're gonna
24:11,trap him early why do you do that to
24:14,give them a lot of different looks
24:16,inside you don't want him just flying up
24:18,the field and getting after Tom Brady
24:20,nice play call whoops
24:23,second at two and that's gone Kowski
24:25,moving around and that'll cost him five
24:27,yards number 87 that's the first penalty
24:37,against the Patriot offense in this
24:41,entire postseason
24:42,I think jeans territory has more fun at
24:44,football than you do he does brought his
24:47,index card tonight had a sign it hello
24:50,as he did the one that got the first
24:54,down for Dallas against Oakland in
24:57,December second down and seven
25:01,Brady stays in the pocket and then the
25:03,pass is incomplete tented therefore
25:06,crisp bogan covered well third down and
25:09,seven one of the big matchups on the
25:12,outside it's going to be Vinny curry
25:14,going against Nate solder at that left
25:16,tackle position you know the Patriots
25:18,are going to want to try and help inside
25:20,where Fletcher Cox and company Brandon
25:23,Graham can really cause some damage in
25:26,there so that means probably Nate solder
25:28,has to stand up all night
25:30,we'll take Chris long with 56 into the
25:33,defensive front
25:39,James White is the back
25:43,[Applause]
25:45,rady under pressure slips away
25:50,freeze Danny Hammond
25:52,and breaking tackles and taking it over
25:54,to the 29 yard line
25:56,Danny playoff Amendola is his new
26:00,nickname there we go right down the
26:03,sidelines going to be right there and
26:05,this is just a blown coverage you saw
26:07,Ronald Darby moving inside it was a zone
26:10,defense and Tom Brady knew it his wide
26:13,receivers on the outside flip-flopped
26:15,spots the Eagles didn't adjust he knew
26:17,exactly what he had
26:18,[Applause]
26:20,a minute to go now in the quarter from
26:22,the 29 yard line play
26:26,fires caught Hogan back Panza and picks
26:29,up a first down on the gain of 12 to the
26:31,17 yard line tackled there by Corey
26:33,Graham when we have seen this Eagles
26:36,defense all season long lead the league
26:39,highest percentage of three and outs and
26:42,yet they are really struggling with this
26:43,pace top rate
26:47,no huddle again
26:50,the 11-yard lump we've had a lot of
26:51,offense I mean we haven't even played a
26:54,quarter New England is 149 yards in New
26:57,England or Philadelphia is 149 in New
27:00,England has 138 and Tom Brady is like do
27:04,not get in arguments or fighters out
27:07,here on the field I think guys are tired
27:09,let's wear them down get out of those
27:11,altercations
27:12,don't let them rotate second and four
27:17,slipping through the middle taking it to
27:20,the eighth and it'll take us to the end
27:21,of the quarter James White is there so
27:25,the next period begins with the third
27:26,down and 1 into 1 9 3 Philadelphia Super
27:30,Bowl 52 an NBC continues after these
27:33,messages
27:34,[Music]
27:38,second quarter
27:40,Al Michaels Cris Collinsworth Michele
27:41,Tafoya there are your stats the update
27:44,there with 289 yards of total offense
27:49,and each quarterback has thrown for over
27:53,a hundred yards already right now at his
27:57,third bound and two as we begin the
28:00,second frame Brandon Bolden comes into
28:03,the game and now they move him into the
28:04,back field behind Brady
28:12,and the mall has handed off to Brandon
28:14,cooks who tries to hurdle and can't
28:18,tackled by McLeod so cooks who came over
28:21,in a trade with the Saints in the
28:23,offseason on the end around McLeod is
28:25,right there jet sweeps gonna come right
28:28,over here and this is the first time
28:30,I've ever seen a straddle into a tackle
28:33,he tries to jump in split and he just
28:37,does not get there so once again the
28:40,Eagles defense makes a very unique stand
28:43,this time inside the 10-yard line Edwin
28:46,Moses a renowned on nehemiah that was
28:49,not woo missed a ski for eight
28:54,26:50 attempt which is juggle and he
28:56,hits the upright Cardona was the snapper
29:02,so each team has missed a kick
29:06,Philadelphian extra point and New
29:09,England missing a field goal attempt
29:13,it's gonna be bobbled inside somehow
29:16,Allen gets it back on the tee and
29:19,Gostkowski tried it tried to slide back
29:22,to the right but caught the upright and
29:25,for Bill Belichick what a disappointment
29:28,he was telling us he felt like that
29:30,special teams were the strengths of this
29:32,team and now it hurts special teams
29:36,coach Joe judge you see that very often
29:40,beautiful loves it of course
29:44,and it's nine to three boy remember that
29:47,tackle on a third and two to set up that
29:51,field goal to set up that mess so now
29:56,from the 20-yard line
30:00,Nichole's who is eight of 11 for 102
30:05,yards
30:06,it tosses it to giant trying to get
30:09,around the corner runs into his own man
30:11,and that's a tough two yards we took him
30:14,down today one of about three really
30:17,core defenses you're gonna see these
30:19,three guys playing inside so now you run
30:23,off tackle or you run outside or you
30:25,throw the football and so the
30:27,Philadelphia Eagles and jhi and now I
30:29,thought one of the huge things that came
30:33,out of this trade with agile is the fact
30:35,that it gave them that outside speed the
30:38,Garrett plant we saw him run up the
30:40,middle he's a big strong guy but a je
30:42,has really made a difference on this
30:44,Eagles team second down and eight on 22
30:50,[Music]
30:52,looked at and he throws that one away
30:57,seems like a million years ago we were
31:00,there opening night in Fox remember how
31:02,it started
31:02,everybody thought New England did so
31:04,much during the offseason they might
31:06,have a perfect season that ended in
31:08,three hours yeah that was pretty
31:09,short-lived there but this is a defense
31:12,for the New England Patriots that has
31:15,made tremendous strides gave up 32
31:17,points a game the first four games of
31:20,the season 300 yard passes the first six
31:22,and yet they pieced it all back together
31:24,and now the pressures on to find some
31:27,answers here tonight start at two and
31:30,two and Counting postseason they've won
31:31,13 of the last 14 only a Monday night
31:34,loss at Miami
31:36,I'm skirt down at eight pulls backing up
31:39,backing away escaping keeps his eyes
31:42,down feeling the pass is incomplete at
31:44,the 30-yard line tended for urge still
31:47,the crowd wants a flag and don't get one
31:51,fourth down yeah I think that Nick Foles
31:54,had a chance here let's take a look it's
31:55,man coverage so everybody's chasing
31:57,everybody here he escapes look out to
32:00,the right probably would have run for
32:02,the first down so the first three and
32:08,out Donny Jones 14 years in the league
32:13,first time he's been in the Superbowl
32:17,[Applause]
32:23,to
32:25,both punters in this game left-footed
32:28,and that's fair caught at the 37 yard
32:30,line by Danny Amendola early in the
32:34,second he goes by 5th
32:36,[Music]
32:41,the Eagle dealer the first team since
32:43,the o2 Buccaneers to reach the Super
32:46,Bowl after allowing fewer than ten
32:48,points per game in the playoffs
32:49,those were the 2002 Buccaneers coached
32:52,by Jon Gruden and went to Tampa Bay that
32:55,year and turned around beat his old team
32:57,Oakland in the Super Bowl in San Diego
32:59,then went back yes he did
33:01,[Applause]
33:06,the lowest is the running back is
33:09,this Drive starts from the 37 yard line
33:13,stepping up
33:15,wide open Brandon cooks and he gets
33:18,smacked down at the 40-yard line
33:20,taking some shock there by Jenkins so he
33:23,was spinning around and he is down and
33:26,the Brady was bent over a little bit
33:28,during the commercial break first out in
33:31,ten but Tom on the worse for wear throws
33:33,almost picked there by Malcolm Jenkins
33:37,intended for James White second down at
33:39,ten wait this was a bit of a surprise
33:41,for me that Malcolm Jenkins is coming
33:44,out and playing man-to-man on James
33:46,White Way got 14 passes and last super
33:49,moment be a surprise but I think most
33:51,people anticipated that Jenkins was
33:54,going to be on Gronkowski but so far
33:56,that matchup is working in the Eagles
33:59,favor meanwhile McDaniels and company
34:01,have to wonder about
34:03,number two receiver they have only four
34:06,wideouts dressed for the game as one
34:10,and scheme their helmet flying DM Lewis
34:13,picks up about five you take a look at
34:17,brainy two Kooks he was the deep threat
34:20,picked him up at a trade with New
34:23,Orleans more than 20 yards downfield 16
34:26,completions Brady's most by one teammate
34:30,in a season
34:32,now the next closest to give you some
34:35,perspective was Randy Moss in that
34:36,unbelievable year he had he did not
34:39,match that number of books Phillip
34:42,Dorsett will take his spot puts his spot
34:44,under 13
34:46,a third and five here
34:49,flip back here today
34:52,and throws and it's Brady who can pull
34:55,it in so Brady was free looks over a
34:59,shoulder trickery and deceit fourth down
35:02,has to be out of the shotgun or this
35:04,play is not legal it obviously is Tom
35:07,Brady is just going to hand off and then
35:10,ignore I he's not doing it
35:11,and there he goes an immediately Chris
35:14,Lauren knew he was in trouble and Brady
35:17,with the bad hand and no tape you wonder
35:21,if maybe that had a little something to
35:23,do with why he didn't want that pat on
35:24,that hand they had that place in the
35:26,back of their mind you do so as forth
35:29,that and 5a go forth from the
35:32,35 yard line
35:39,and Grady down the sideline and this
35:42,incomplete Gronkowski the intended
35:45,receiver Jalen Mills covering on a play
35:48,and fill it up it will take over 11:53
35:54,to the half nine to three
35:59,[Music]
36:02,what's really interesting here Malcom
36:04,Butler hero three years ago in the Super
36:07,Bowl has not played a defensive snap
36:09,tonight the Patriots are telling us a
36:12,coach's decision of course it was easier
36:15,to get information out of East Germany
36:16,before the wall went down than to get
36:19,injury information from New England but
36:21,Butler has not played a defensive snap
36:23,yet Eric Roe has taken his spine here's
36:26,a giant
36:28,it's wrapped up one yard behind the line
36:30,of scrimmage this was during America the
36:33,Beautiful Butler was very emotional on
36:36,the sidelines can't guess what this was
36:40,about but he's played on special teams
36:42,tonight but not on defense well it was a
36:45,beautiful rendition so you never know
36:47,right
36:47,but you have to think that maybe he was
36:50,hurting a bit and you just wonder when
36:52,it was that he got the news or maybe it
36:55,was just the reaction to it maybe it
36:57,wasn't any of the above final year of
36:59,his contract but for a while as if he
37:02,would be sent to the Saints in the
37:03,offseason didn't happen here's a jockey
37:06,trying to break tackles which he does
37:08,with regularity and turns nothing into a
37:11,little something up at the 38 yard line
37:12,Devin McCourty makes the tackle third
37:15,down and 7 I'll tell you this Jay Ajay
37:19,he runs that lead draw about as well as
37:22,anybody they end up pulling Lane Johnson
37:25,around one of the most athletic guys in
37:28,blocking him in there but so far this
37:30,five-man line of the New England
37:33,Patriots has been doing pretty well at
37:35,least in the last couple of series now
37:37,and shutting down that run
37:42,Ajay averaging 3 yards per tote third
37:45,down and seven now from the 38 yard line
37:48,[Applause]
37:52,put an end to Patriot territory goes
37:54,Zach Ertz the tight end in a nineteen
37:59,yeah I think Zach Ertz took a little
38:01,page out of Gronk's book here and it go
38:04,down the field a little bit physical and
38:06,then make the break
38:07,a little bit of a contact not enough for
38:13,a flag I think that was the proper call
38:15,their little Juke I tell you if there's
38:18,one guy that could be an explosive
38:20,element of this game Zach Ertz his wife
38:23,Julie if you follow soccer you know
38:25,she's a key member of the u.s. women's
38:27,team
38:30,from the fortieth three yard line
38:35,keeps it in
38:37,didn't have a grip on it look like now
38:39,Sean Jeffrey the intended receiver will
38:42,be second down at ten you got to worked
38:45,over throw Alshon Jeffery sometimes it's
38:48,interesting I wonder if it'd happen to
38:49,Nick there that sometimes those running
38:51,backs don't know if they're getting the
38:53,ball or not and they can tend to grab at
38:55,it a little bit maybe it jostled it just
38:58,a bit before that throw
38:59,looks like he didn't have a good grip on
39:01,it so it's second down and ten u.s. Bank
39:07,Stadium in the Minneapolis on this Super
39:10,Bowl Sunday night second down 10 from
39:12,the 43 yard line
39:13,[Applause]
39:20,intended for gin free at the 21-yard
39:22,line parade catch over the shoulder
39:27,along the sideline threw it over Stephon
39:30,Gilmore
39:31,that's a game 222 first down yeah watch
39:35,this late adjustment to the ball here
39:37,and I'm a little surprised Chung that
39:40,time ended up being on al Sean Jeffrey
39:43,and we all anticipated that Stephon
39:45,Gilmore was going to be the matchup
39:47,Gilmore all season long has taken the
39:50,bigger of the receivers and yet for
39:52,whatever reason they're not matching him
39:54,against Jeffrey in this one he already
39:56,has one long touchdown big play there
39:58,two touchdowns in the championship game
40:00,against Minnesota
40:03,one swings to the outside inside the 10
40:07,block to the end zone behind a Civic
40:10,block his 11th career postseason TV
40:24,most athletic center and football watch
40:26,them get out in front of this play not
40:28,only gets the initial cutoff which you
40:30,have to have on those outside zones
40:32,stays with it one more push down the
40:35,field get to Landon Roberts out of the
40:37,way and there you go for LeGarrette
40:39,Blount how sweet is this payback
40:41,[Applause]
40:46,now they're going to go for two right
40:49,after missing the extra point that makes
40:50,the difference trying to make it 17 to 3
40:53,instead of 16 Eagles go forward a lot
40:57,six of nine for two-point conversions
40:59,both most attempts and conversions in
41:03,the lead so from the two yard line
41:05,I listen for receivers out to the right
41:08,side whole bunch they're naturally go to
41:11,the left and it's Jeffrey and he can't
41:13,make the catch that's Eric Rowe able to
41:16,bust it up 848 to go first half now 15
41:20,to 3 Philadelphia
41:22,[Music]
41:25,well you recognize JLo and a rod taken
41:31,in the action Mike Trapp the great
41:33,California angel huge Eagle fan goes to
41:37,all their games there he is you know
41:41,your family you're standing up the whole
41:42,game lob it from the 25-yard line
41:45,the back is Birkhead double fake and
41:49,makes the catch and Rex Burkhead gets
41:52,free has a block from Amendola front
41:55,beginning from behind his quarry Graham
41:58,so they put Birkhead in the game and
42:01,right off the bat he's good for 47 a lot
42:04,of pressure around Tom Brady but just
42:06,enough distraction just as that defense
42:09,thought they were going to get number 12
42:10,he flips it out in another big play down
42:13,the field
42:14,[Applause]
42:17,[Music]
42:19,under pressure and the blob we pass is
42:23,incomplete you know it was Burkett as we
42:26,take a look at the replay
42:28,it was Burkett who makes the catch here
42:32,he was the guy that collided with Brady
42:34,17 days ago which caused the massive cut
42:38,we asked Brady about that the other day
42:41,we said what was your first thought he
42:42,said my season is over and Birkhead
42:45,probably thought his career was 2nd down
42:51,and 10 from the 29 yard line
42:56,get stuffed before he can get untracked
43:01,making a third down and eight now
43:04,they've worked this play a couple of
43:05,times and they whistled it right past
43:07,the ear hole of any curry twice he might
43:09,end up intercepting one you can see
43:11,Brady tinya had the laces that is a
43:14,second one he is barely missed they were
43:16,trying to slow down his pass rush these
43:19,hits are starting to pile up just a bit
43:21,on Tom Brady
43:23,initially now wait comes into the
43:25,backfield
43:26,[Applause]
43:29,third and eight
43:33,and Ola comes into the backfield and
43:35,that pass goes nowhere so a lot of
43:38,action a lot of movement
43:39,nothing forth innate I mean these are
43:44,screen passes that they can't get off
43:47,Chris long comes flying around the end
43:50,there and for Josh McDaniels he has to
43:52,think well I knew these guys were going
43:55,to be pretty good coming after my
43:58,quarterback but I didn't think I'd get
43:59,to the point when we couldn't run a
44:01,screen pass there he was begging to play
44:03,on the outside against James White had
44:05,to throw it away now a 45-year under 210
44:07,it's Kowski
44:10,this time the snap is good hold is
44:13,perfect and the kick is likewise halfway
44:17,through the second quarter it's
44:19,Philadelphia 15 New England's second
44:23,Super Bowl xxxii
44:25,[Music]
44:25,[Applause]
44:29,back with the score 15 to 6 and we
44:31,talked about New England perfect season
44:33,one away on opening night
44:36,they still wound up with a mark over 13
44:39,and 3 Tom Brady knowing all the things
44:42,with McDaniels and we go to Michele well
44:45,Brandon cooks the Patriots wide receiver
44:47,who took that hard hit from Malcolm
44:48,Jenkins went back to the locker room al
44:50,he will not return they are calling it a
44:52,head injury they haven't called it a
44:54,concussion just a head injury back in
44:56,the locker room will not return out so
44:58,they down a three wide receivers Michele
45:01,you know Chris we were talking about how
45:03,New England season started but they
45:05,rebounded you look at the Philadelphia
45:08,season I mean there were seven and nine
45:09,last year they started out a house on
45:12,fire they were number one in a lot of
45:14,the power poles until they went to Los
45:17,Angeles and lost carson wentz in
45:19,december yeah and to be fair we saw a
45:23,couple of good games out of nick foles
45:24,and then at the end of the season to
45:27,very poor games and then it was Doug
45:30,Peterson and Frank Reich both of whom
45:32,had been backup quarterbacks for
45:34,extended periods of their careers going
45:36,back having that extra week and taking a
45:39,good long look at what it was that Nick
45:42,Foles did in 2013 with Chip Kelly that
45:45,was so successful they incorporated some
45:48,of that and then by the time the
45:49,playoffs started he was rolling so Frank
45:53,Reich author of two of the greatest
45:55,comebacks in football history one in
45:57,college in Maryland
45:59,and of course one with the Buffalo Bills
46:01,against then Houston Oilers little
46:03,surprised he didn't get some action if
46:05,they had Cochise derby sooner or later
46:09,[Music]
46:11,miss kau skis kick
46:15,taking two yards into the endzone so
46:19,let's look at the quarterbacks at this
46:20,point in the game 143 yards off the hand
46:24,of Falls and 191 already for Tom Brady
46:29,you know it's the most bizarre stat not
46:31,shown there maybe the biggest play one
46:34,drop Tom Brady go figure in the bathroom
46:39,Amendola
46:43,brian hoyer his backup quarterback
46:46,going over the tablet with him so here
46:49,his folds almost quit almost quit after
46:52,it was released by the rams went on a
46:54,camping trip with his brother-in-law and
46:58,sit when he was going to come back
46:59,there's only one guy he was gonna play
47:01,for it Andy Reid and we'd brought him to
47:04,Kansas City last year and backed up Alex
47:07,Smith
47:11,from the 25-yard line and you got
47:14,movement Bert's second time for him he
47:25,took them from the two yard line to the
47:26,7 yard line on the other fall start now
47:29,that one took probably four points off
47:32,the board there with that one but
47:34,believe me Zach Ertz and these inside
47:38,receivers I keep thinking this it's
47:40,going to be an inside game throwing the
47:42,ball the other one Nelson Aguilar inside
47:44,as well
47:45,[Applause]
47:52,women
47:54,picks up one Clement getting an
47:57,opportunity to play a lot this season
47:58,when they lost Darren Sproles to a
48:01,season-ending injury in week 3 undrafted
48:04,rookie out of Wisconsin he's done a
48:06,great job well I don't know how many
48:08,times we've done this with the
48:10,Pittsburgh Steelers but James Harrison
48:12,you want somebody to set the edge on
48:13,your defense and of course that's the
48:15,very fundamental part of Bill
48:18,Belichick's
48:18,defenses who better than that guy he is
48:21,a hammer see him lift wait some time
48:25,second and 14
48:27,Harrison 39 years old and says he's
48:29,still playing next year
48:30,[Applause]
48:35,gets it away
48:37,Torrey Smith spins his way up to the 31
48:41,yard line
48:42,tackle ear bike gilmore and makes it
48:46,third down and three I love what Nick
48:47,Foles is doing sees the Blitz throat
48:50,right behind it if you see the Blitz
48:52,coming just throw it right over his head
48:55,there he is
48:56,nice pickup
48:59,[Applause]
49:01,Nick Foles is seeing the field new who
49:05,they're going for
49:09,six minutes to go in the opening half
49:19,rajaiah an inside handoff look at him go
49:23,Jay Ajayi to the 40-yard line knee goes
49:28,down there tons of yardage he and blunt
49:32,both massive amounts of yardage after
49:34,contact case in point their third and
49:38,four how many times do you see here's
49:40,Wisniewski right here but also on the
49:42,outside we had Nelson Aguilar with a
49:45,great block but how many times out have
49:47,we seen this year Doug Peterson on third
49:49,and four it's a pass down for everybody
49:52,in the league pick up big plays running
49:54,the football like he just did he's got
49:55,those two backs from the 44 on first
49:59,down foes going deep down the sideline
50:02,and his jugular Center Bannerman at the
50:06,three yard line
50:07,Jeffery couldn't handle it
50:09,and the Wyndham gets the take away on a
50:12,deflection into the arms of Harmony
50:19,[Applause]
50:21,first turnover
50:24,the one-handed no even - the ball
50:27,[Applause]
50:31,two college roommates from South
50:33,Carolina going at it on that last play
50:36,Stephon Gilmore finally got his shot
50:38,against Alshon Jeffrey good coverage but
50:41,Jeffrey really is the one that's gonna
50:42,flip it back to the middle of the field
50:45,to Durant Harmon who led this team with
50:47,four interceptions career high for him
50:50,but watch the tale into this got it may
50:53,be and then just flips it back to the
50:55,middle of the field and herman said
50:57,thank you very much exactly what the
50:59,patriots needed and start this drive
51:02,from their own 10-yard line
51:03,[Applause]
51:06,Louis is the running back dead on the
51:10,floor back and he gets crunched at four
51:12,again for my Kendricks and we go to
51:14,Michelle well I spoke with both Alshon
51:16,Jeffery and Stephon Gilmore before the
51:17,game you know Jeffrey was Gilmore's a
51:20,groomsman and his wedding they each
51:22,talked about the fun they had in college
51:24,competing but this is their first
51:26,meeting as pros and Jeffrey told me
51:27,their battle tonight would be a good one
51:29,but he said it's been a long time since
51:31,college and I'm pretty sure he got
51:33,better just like I got better out no
51:35,question Jeffrey I'm already off to a
51:37,good start for the touchdown and three
51:41,catches for 73 second down and six from
51:45,the 14 yard line Rainey over to the
51:47,middle and that's dropped at the 19 yard
51:50,line incomplete Gronkowski could not
51:53,handle it Ron cassie's caught one
51:55,tonight for nine yards that's it yeah
51:57,this has been a little bit of an unusual
52:00,game and I think that right now the
52:03,Patriots have to reconsider a little bit
52:06,what they're doing Gronkowski needs more
52:08,and I think these backs need a little
52:10,more action coming out of the backfield
52:11,James White's going to come out wide
52:15,once again Malcolm Jenkins on him maybe
52:17,not quite the matchup that Brady liked
52:19,the Jenkins
52:24,thirty-six fired that's incomplete flat
52:28,comes in though Chris Hogan with Jaylin
52:31,Mills on the coverage first leg on a
52:37,pass play
52:45,prior to the past holding defense in the
52:49,31 here's the matchup right inside
52:58,they're going across let's take a look
53:00,and see if Mills hooks that hip and
53:02,turns them that's what they're going to
53:05,call I believe
53:08,there's the hole now that was Teahupoo
53:10,was influence
53:13,and it's a first down after a third and
53:15,six scooting up to the 25-yard line goes
53:18,beyond Lewis it was their leading rush
53:21,of this year with 896 yards second bomb
53:25,well we've talked about him before but
53:28,Fletcher Cox just one of the real stars
53:31,in the National Football League and the
53:33,thing al that I appreciate more than
53:35,anything about him he's not just the
53:37,pass rush that guy has a way of finding
53:39,the ball carrier devastating initial
53:43,punch and then finds the ball carrier
53:45,from the outside
53:48,to the 32 ghost Dion Lewis Zeppelin with
53:52,the block yeah there's a reason like Cox
53:53,is the highest-paid guy on the team you
53:55,don't see that very often for an
53:57,interior defensive lineman yeah we've
54:00,got a few good ones around the league
54:02,Aaron Donald named the Defensive Player
54:04,of the Year right and this guy is pretty
54:07,much right there behind him we haven't
54:09,seen a ton from Brandon Graham Brandon
54:11,Graham is the leading sacker on this
54:13,team and a guy that gets a lot of
54:15,pressure as well this defensive line now
54:18,these are some of the moments they need
54:20,to win the battle Graham had nine sacks
54:23,during the regular season that there he
54:26,wasn't a sideline first down now play
54:29,clock at one
54:32,protection clothes into traffic and
54:34,that's incomplete well covered
54:36,Ranma cloud on Gronkowski to make it
54:39,circuit down in ten interesting a that
54:42,was sort of a bang-bang play right at
54:45,the top end of that route let's watch
54:47,McCloud come down
54:50,they're gonna say he's going for the
54:52,fall there have been a few like that it
54:54,is always so difficult they are not
54:58,going to give you the benefit of the
54:59,doubt not in the Super Bowl
55:03,white is the back on second to ten he
55:06,stays in the block
55:08,brainy going deep down on the right
55:10,behind and rolls it in at the 25-yard
55:14,line
55:14,got fast jaylen Mills another big play
55:18,for Hogan any time the Patriots want to
55:21,go down the field they're going to chip
55:23,with these guys on the outside to by
55:25,Brady a little more time and I've been
55:27,waiting for this one to happen because
55:30,the New England Patriots knew that
55:32,jaylen Mills has given up a lot of these
55:34,double moves on the season a little
55:36,hesitate and go and now the Patriots
55:39,have a great long drive going Dean of 43
55:43,Hogan's already caught three 483 Brady's
55:48,from for 234 to this point
55:50,go left side James White inside the 10
55:54,snakes it to the end zone that's
55:56,dangerous
56:02,26 yards 90 yard drive kept alive by a
56:08,holding penalty and in they go in seven
56:12,plays really nice job anytime you get
56:16,big runs you need plays on the backside
56:18,watch Shaq Mason here go get the
56:21,linebacker watch Cameron Fleming with
56:23,the cutoff block on Jernigan and that is
56:25,going to allow James White to get in the
56:27,open field and that guy just keeps doing
56:30,it super balls holy smokes that seven
56:33,touchdowns for white in his last four
56:35,postseason games
56:38,next one is no good go figure we've met
56:41,to miss extra points in a field goal and
56:47,with 204 it's 15 to 12 once again go
56:52,back to the snap good won't look pretty
56:58,good looked like there was a little
57:00,bobble on the tail end of that hold and
57:02,maybe just a half a boy you know and
57:07,when something goes wrong early and it
57:10,gets in your head a little bit and now
57:11,you have to wonder should this thing
57:13,come down see that little readjust right
57:16,in the last second but now you start to
57:19,think boy this looks like it's gonna be
57:20,one of those back-and-forth close games
57:22,that the Patriots always seem to play
57:24,but now we're confident they are kicking
57:26,those field goals now 4 seconds from the
57:31,two-minute warning
57:32,[Music]
57:36,12
57:42,lemon and foreigner
57:49,this time it is cornered
57:53,then I swung back and then he gets pop
57:55,like estas tuna
57:59,kicker knocks him down two-minute
58:01,warning
58:02,Eagles by 3
58:05,[Music]
58:13,downtown Minneapolis this building on
58:17,the old footprint of the Metrodome tore
58:20,that down they played for two years over
58:22,the University of Minnesota Stadium
58:24,architectural marvel built in the shape
58:28,and image of a Viking ship home of the
58:30,Vikings Doug Peterson is it
58:33,unleash right here
58:35,[Applause]
58:40,it's run under the bounds after again
58:42,seven yards by Jordan Richards second
58:45,down and three we've seen the Patriots
58:49,play from behind a lot right they did
58:52,against Jacksonville in the championship
58:54,game of course the Super Bowl last year
58:56,and I think everybody in the National
58:58,Football League especially Doug Peterson
59:00,has been watching and they know they
59:04,have to play this one all the way out
59:06,like they're either tied or behind and
59:09,they will be firing here
59:11,second down and three
59:13,[Applause]
59:17,- this side hold in 47 yard line but
59:21,incomplete didn't get to the ground with
59:23,it
59:24,Torrey Smith couldn't complete the
59:26,process Eric row with the coverage makes
59:29,it third down and three why you keep
59:31,playing watch row here just keep
59:32,fighting and keep fighting as he's going
59:35,to the ground the ball comes out
59:37,[Applause]
59:38,[Music]
59:41,it's good coffee
59:43,lise under the old rules we'll see what
59:45,the new rules are gonna be who knows
59:49,that's a big drop though
59:51,that should have been a first down
59:54,on the ball back and have them go down
59:57,the field woman's gonna get the second
59:58,half ticked off as well
60:00,third and three and that is floated and
60:04,caught down the sideline by
60:06,Corey Clement breaks the tackle inside
60:09,the 20 makes it first on the goal a
60:13,little floater perfect touch Corey
60:18,Clement for 55 yards
60:20,Jordan Richards overly aggressive gets
60:22,hit with the swing route right there
60:24,they're going to try and pick inside
60:25,didn't have to but you could tell that
60:28,Richards felt like with that possible
60:29,pick coming he had to loop underneath
60:32,and that's what created the opening out
60:34,there for Clement Harmon could not make
60:39,the tackle he got stiff arm ball is at
60:43,the 9 yard line Leo that over 600 total
60:45,yards in the game
60:47,[Applause]
60:48,under a minute
60:55,through the middle still on his feet
60:58,lemons well he's the third down back but
61:03,he's been a bull here at second down and
61:04,gold and Grady Bella trick timeout is
61:13,taken here now this is a stuff this this
61:17,is a stuff they should have had this for
61:19,about a 2-yard game but Clement just
61:22,kept driving and he is really making a
61:25,statement so far in this game he got a
61:27,lot of practice time this week because
61:30,of the ankle injury to je je and he's
61:33,been sensational he really has come on
61:35,here at the end of the season the
61:36,timeout was taken by New England trying
61:40,to conserve some time if they could get
61:42,the ball back and limit maybe to a field
61:45,goal second down and goal
61:51,well you know - you know what the
61:53,Patriots love those double ups right get
61:56,the ball at the end of the half and then
61:58,be able to take advantage and certainly
62:00,they hurt Jacksonville with that score
62:02,at the end of the half in the
62:03,championship game now they've got the
62:05,full house backfield gone but I bet this
62:07,shift check this out at least for the
62:08,moment
62:12,a lot of shifting remember tackle are
62:14,still in the back
62:17,women
62:19,lemon playing the role of fullback he's
62:23,gonna get to the one-yard line it'll be
62:25,third down and goal and another timeout
62:27,is taken here by New England Toyota
62:30,halftime report coming up guys break
62:32,down the first half
62:33,today what each team needs to do in the
62:35,second half coming up at the half in
62:40,addition to birth to Justin Timberlake
62:42,yeah I was gonna say as much as
62:44,everybody wants to hear what they have
62:46,to say they might be hanging around for
62:49,Justin Timberlake and what you're gonna
62:51,do at halftime no no no there's no no
62:54,challenge hashtag Al Michaels I can see
62:57,you shake your booties on though you're
62:59,not going for Justin's killing me I'm
63:00,talking
63:01,[Music]
63:04,doesn't go with spinal stenosis in big
63:07,moment right here third down and goal
63:09,from the one five receivers and coverage
63:15,watch the pecs
63:18,and to the outside and Jeffrey it's
63:21,taken down in the end zone by Gilmore
63:25,and no flag so fourth and goal let's
63:31,take a look right there just one on one
63:33,on the outside I don't think there's
63:37,enough action there I thought that's a
63:39,good call
63:39,look a little bit more like Jeffrey was
63:41,just falling back for the ball Peterson
63:45,wanted a call and did not get it are
63:49,they really gonna go for us they're
63:51,lining up to go for it anyway from the
63:53,one yard line with 38 seconds whoa baby
63:57,he's a gambler and they're good at
64:00,two-point conversions they might have a
64:02,play they really like Philadelphia
64:05,30-second timeout taking a look at what
64:09,how the Patriots were lining up 17
64:14,fourth down conversions that's the most
64:17,by any team in almost a decade one for
64:19,one in the two playoff games Doug
64:23,Peterson what a job he has done a long
64:25,time back up Dan Marino is in front of
64:29,him Miami in them for many years Brett
64:30,Favre
64:32,on Andy Reid's staff when he got into
64:34,coaching in the NFL decade ago he's
64:38,coaching high school in Louisiana this
64:40,is an unbelievable call this is like
64:42,going for the onside kick against Peyton
64:46,Manning because you don't want him to
64:48,get the ball too many times you don't
64:49,think you can hold him out and here we
64:51,go
64:52,this could decide the game
64:55,once it goes
65:00,and they're gonna snap it
65:02,it's trained bird niiice poor fools
65:05,touchdown
65:10,how do you figure
65:16,they go to the very very very back of
65:19,the playbook from the touchdown Trabert
65:23,a college quarterback and watched all
65:27,the action polls going to sneak over
65:29,here direct snap everybody comes up and
65:32,here we go
65:33,what a play call by Doug Peterson this
65:37,play call has a chance to be remembered
65:40,as one of the all-time greats just going
65:42,for it and to complete the pass that the
65:45,Patriots could not
65:48,- Burton - Foles Elliott for the extra
65:53,point
65:53,Wow 34 SEC's Paul
65:57,let's do Staley long time running back
66:01,coach there we go they've got all these
66:06,signals shotgun he would not have been
66:09,eligible but for the fact he was in the
66:11,shotgun not under center and there's the
66:14,old basketball player they talked about
66:16,Nick Foles he's more comfortable playing
66:19,quarterback like a point guard and here
66:22,he is receiving
66:24,the past that is going to be shown a
66:27,billion times it is Mike Trapp of the
66:31,California Angels LA Angels of Anaheim
66:34,you know Chris we started out by talking
66:37,about as you look at Patricia on the
66:39,other side about Doug Peterson he's
66:43,gonna be aggressive that says he's
66:45,aggressive as you could possibly be go
66:46,for him to fort them with the all time
66:49,trick play one of the all-time gutsy
66:52,calls right there you don't make that
66:54,give it back to Brady right there that
66:57,was second-guessed forever what a call
67:02,down in the end zone here so the
67:04,Patriots are going to get it with 34
67:06,seconds trying to at least to get into
67:08,field goal rings one timeout
67:11,so the pass to Brady did not work the
67:13,pass the polls did we saw it they had
67:15,their own trick play set it up perfectly
67:17,had Brady wide open could not make the
67:22,play and on the other end much younger
67:25,Nick Foles did
67:26,[Applause]
67:29,breathtaking that's breathtaking in a
67:31,Super Bowl
67:32,that's a breathtaking call 323 yards
67:39,in the first half for Philadelphia so
67:41,Brady with a little time to try to get
67:44,him down the field
67:47,detection is outstanding
67:50,into double coverage and then complete
67:52,intended for Danny Amendola he had mills
67:55,back there with Cory Graham that took
67:57,seven seconds off the clock second down
67:59,any time if you're gonna take away
68:01,Gronkowski you have to take away this
68:03,seam route look at all the action out
68:06,here and I think it's making Brady crazy
68:08,this is their go-to play when you're
68:10,talking about Gronkowski and yet they
68:12,have been right underneath it all night
68:14,long good play there by Amendola just to
68:20,break up the interception Rainey hitting
68:22,only 50% 10 to 20 but the 234
68:26,fires and that's going to be hauled in
68:28,at the 45-yard line Phillip Dorsett
68:31,makes his first catch and New England
68:34,will take its final timeout with 20
68:37,seconds well you have to remember now
68:39,what the loss of Brandon cooks is going
68:42,to mean to this team it folds over
68:44,they're enjoying that little play but
68:47,you've got Brandon cooks who was the
68:50,best deep threat had the most yards of
68:53,any deep threat in the National Football
68:54,League over the last two years and they
68:57,made the deal to bring in Phillip
68:58,Dorsett to this team he's a very similar
69:01,player but doesn't have anywhere close
69:03,to the skillset or the experience that
69:06,Brandon cooks has they'll have to play
69:08,the whole second half the rest of the
69:10,game without cooks he's he's gone they
69:12,played the entire second half against
69:14,Jacksonville two weeks ago without Quan
69:16,Koski and still pulled it out
69:19,personnel
69:22,[Applause]
69:27,rady under pressure gets jostle now he's
69:30,gonna take off
69:32,can't get to the sideline tackle dare by
69:35,Brandon Graham Michigan against Michigan
69:37,they got a race up to the line and maybe
69:39,spike it and throw a Hail Mary because
69:41,the clock is not that of five four and
69:45,he just spikes it they're too far of
69:47,course for a field goal
69:48,one last probable Hail Mary with three
69:51,seconds yeah unfortunately they had
69:56,Chris Hogan all the way down the field
69:58,there and he had to hustle all the way
70:00,back and being short at wide receiver
70:02,maybe they didn't have the natural
70:04,substitution pattern that they might
70:05,have had to leave a little more time on
70:07,that clock I'd say we've seen all the
70:10,trick plays coming out here I don't know
70:12,what we're gonna get here but we'll see
70:16,remembered offensive foul would extend
70:19,the half yeah Doug Peterson wanted to
70:22,talk about it he knew something strange
70:25,was coming what a first half very
70:33,entertaining just fantastic I mean you
70:36,know all of the talk before the game and
70:39,everybody's you know yakking away and
70:41,the stories all of that who could have
70:43,predicted this you know we have seen the
70:46,underdog Philadelphia Eagles all season
70:49,long that little chip on their shoulder
70:51,we're in the dog mask they have warned
70:54,that well Patriots came in they were
70:56,awfully confident about this game but it
70:59,has been the big plays that have really
71:01,eluded the Patriots just a bit and
71:04,eagles have made them and that's been
71:06,the difference though they've relish
71:07,that underdog role they were the 1 seed
71:09,and they weren't underdog to the 6
71:11,Atlanta
71:12,the divisional playoff happens here
71:16,barring a defensive foul
71:18,[Applause]
71:21,and the winner will get the ball to
71:23,start the second half
71:25,said that I'm here to Danny Ammon
71:28,and that will take us to halftime 276
71:37,passing yards for Brady in the half to
71:40,15 for foals
71:41,the Philadelphia Eagles trying to win
71:44,for the first time ever trying to win
71:46,the big game for the first time ever
71:49,don't let's check back to the locker
71:51,room to begin to make his adjustments
71:54,which he makes all game long and he's
71:56,pretty good at halftime - I'll say 28 -
72:00,three last time around they came back in
72:02,one 10-point deficit nothing let's go to
72:05,my show all right with coach Doug
72:07,Peterson fourth and goal from the one
72:09,you call the play that results in a
72:11,touchdown pass to foals what inspired
72:14,the decision to go for it with that call
72:16,well we had just gotten all the way down
72:19,the field and I wasn't gonna stop I
72:21,wasn't gonna let our offense be stopped
72:22,on the one-yard line
72:23,it's a play we've been working the last
72:25,couple of weeks and our guys execute it
72:27,brilliantly no lead is safe against Tom
72:30,Brady what's your message to your team
72:32,at halftime we got thirty minutes of
72:34,football we got we got a refuel we got a
72:36,recharge and we got to play for another
72:38,thirty minutes this is a they're too
72:40,good on that side of that side of the
72:42,field and messages we got to play play

73:19,their swings to the outside block to the
73:21,endzone for LeGarrette Blount how sweet

73:35,[Applause]
73:45,[Music]
73:46,[Applause]
73:55,about as entertaining a first half as
73:57,you can possibly sweet 22 212
74:00,Philadelphia on top at the break first
74:03,Super Bowl
74:04,both teams each gain 300 or more yards
74:06,in the first half Falls and Brady for
74:10,Super Bowl each quarterback passing for
74:13,200 or more in the first half Falls the
74:15,first ever in 52 Super Bowls first ever
74:17,quarterback to catch a touchdown pass 9
74:20,different players with a rush or a catch
74:22,of 20 plus yards plenty of offense 673
74:30,yards worth of offense against one team
74:33,that was number four in defensive
74:34,scoring and the other team number five
74:37,just warming up al here we go second
74:41,half in Minneapolis under the way
74:44,[Applause]
74:45,we'll take a knee there the Loess we go
74:48,to Michelle I got a chance to speak with
74:50,Bill Belichick and I asked him why he
74:52,did not start Malcolm Butler and why
74:54,Butler's not playing on defense and he
74:56,said I made the decisions that give us
74:58,the best chance to win and as far as
75:00,trying to stop their run he said we got
75:02,to do better in all phases out all right
75:05,little bit warmer semantics Samba
75:08,they're right for building what else is
75:11,new that was about what we expect of
75:12,course Thank You Michelle
75:16,from the 25-yard line
75:17,[Applause]
75:20,Grady begins this drive tom 12:23
75:25,[Applause]
75:28,there's an errant intended for
75:31,Gronkowski can't connect with him
75:33,Gronkowski tonight one catch for nine
75:35,yards period
75:36,Brady's missing these throws this is
75:38,wide open here's the seam against the
75:40,single safety look this is their bread
75:42,and butter this is Tom Brady and Rob
75:45,Gronkowski 25 throws out of 25 they're
75:49,going to hit that and we have seen
75:51,tonight Tom Brady missed some of these
75:53,throws I don't know if his hands an
75:55,issue and he has missed some throws
75:57,tonight when without that tape tonight
75:59,white is the back again cooks out of the
76:02,game head injury lost in the first half
76:08,lady stepping up avoids the pressure
76:10,throws him this time it is caught by
76:12,Gronkowski he gets free first diagram
76:16,with the tackle 25 yards let's take a
76:18,look at Rob Gronkowski in the first half
76:20,he's had plenty of opportunities and
76:23,just not been able to come up with some
76:25,of those trademark big plays that last
76:28,wasn't thrown a bit behind that was a
76:30,back shoulder but it has been this
76:33,Eagles defense that has continued to
76:35,make big plays big P inside handoff
76:39,and that's Gronkowski so back to back to
76:42,him after that one catch in the first
76:44,half he's caught two in a row Graham
76:47,makes the tackle and that's good for
76:49,twenty four if at first you don't
76:50,succeed it's the exact same play exact
76:53,same play and if you think they're gonna
76:55,call Gronkowski on that little nudge
76:57,forget about it
76:59,325 passing yards
77:01,white slicing through over the left side
77:04,to the 23 yard line you know it's so
77:07,interesting Doug Peterson probably
77:09,looked at the scoreboard it's like
77:13,everybody's okay getting up probably
77:16,looked at the scoreboard when he made
77:17,that decision to go for it on fourth and
77:19,one down there and said with the way
77:20,these guys starts the second half I'm
77:22,gonna be behind by the time I get the
77:24,ball back so he went for it I still
77:26,can't get over that that was so pull
77:29,gutsiest let's see a call as you'll see
77:33,the thugs been doing that a good part of
77:35,the season
77:36,second down and six
77:40,Brady good protection again
77:42,and goes that one out-of-bounds intended
77:45,for devil to pull back incomplete third
77:47,down and six
77:48,that was nice on the outside there by
77:50,Malcolm Jenkins they've been setting
77:52,that play up with James White blanked
77:55,out wide he's gonna fake like he's going
77:57,to go in for the pick Jenkins did not
78:00,fall for it so quote so far the decision
78:03,by Jim Schwartz to take Malcolm Jenkins
78:05,out there on James White has been paying
78:08,dividends
78:11,now skis foot wide to the left
78:15,third and six Raven
78:17,in that direction hits him and Gronk
78:20,gets it inside the 10 takes Graham with
78:23,him sets up a first down of gold yeah
78:26,Brady saw the pressure that time and
78:28,knew he was going to get the one-on-one
78:30,coverage on the outside and took
78:32,advantage that was one of the few
78:33,pressures we've seen so far out of the
78:36,Philadelphia Eagles
78:41,opening drive
78:44,the second half is seventh play
78:47,[Applause]
78:49,taking it down to the five-yard line
78:51,goes James white so they get second down
78:54,and goal you know if you're wondering
78:57,about the strategy think back to what
78:59,happened to the Atlanta Falcons in the
79:01,Superbowl last season of course they
79:03,wore down late and overtime looked
79:05,exhausted but this Philadelphia defense
79:08,came till about seven or eight deep
79:10,along that defensive line shouldn't
79:12,happen to this bunch
79:14,[Applause]
79:22,or man less and then it's caught
79:24,Gronkowski for the touchdown
79:30,so he goes to a silent night to a big
79:33,drive here and gets in for the score
79:40,now they're starting to get the
79:41,combination going he's going to fake
79:43,outside come back inside
79:45,Darby's going to slip just a bit but now
79:48,the combination you go back to that game
79:51,against the Pittsburgh Steelers when
79:52,everything was on the line and what did
79:55,Tom Brady do he just went after
79:57,Gronkowski almost every single
79:59,Gostkowski for the extra points so
80:02,Gronkowski catches four passes on that
80:06,drive they quickly go 75 and turned it
80:09,into a three point game in Minneapolis
80:19,most championships by a player her
80:24,battle e6 with the Packers in Cowboys
80:26,fuzzy Thurston won six with the Colts
80:29,and the Packers most Super Bowls won by
80:31,a player Brady with his five and then
80:34,Haley with the 49ers and the Cowboys won
80:37,five I'll try to break that tie tonight
80:44,took New England two minutes and 45
80:47,seconds to turn it into a three-point
80:50,game
80:50,this is parner can
80:54,with a flag thrown
80:56,Varner guy whose cousin is the mayor of
80:59,st. Paul
81:07,treating starett or only one penalty
81:11,against the wing room tonight four
81:13,against Philadelphia on the return
81:16,illegal block in the back return team
81:19,number 54 10-yard penalty first down
81:22,Philadelphia so far the difference in
81:26,this game has been the trick plays going
81:29,to the quarterbacks first of all Tom
81:32,Brady is a short arm couldn't quite get
81:34,there then Nick pulls
81:35,[Applause]
81:38,so far of this season and so far in this
81:41,game we have seen more passes to
81:43,quarterbacks
81:44,the pass
81:45,[Applause]
81:49,and they want punt in the game by Jones
81:52,of the Eagles the strive begins now with
81:55,Blount forcing his way through the
81:57,middle for a gain of three up to the 18
82:00,yard line it'll be second down and seven
82:03,and you really get the feeling that the
82:06,difference in this game could still be
82:09,the play of this offensive line to
82:11,Philadelphia Eagles had a great first
82:13,half running the football and those big
82:16,guys up front are as good as they can be
82:20,I think arguably the best in football no
82:23,sex in the game
82:25,[Applause]
82:29,fires and it's dropped Nelson a galore
82:33,going into the kicking net covered there
82:35,by Harmon incomplete making it third
82:38,down and six
82:39,where that was one of those take your
82:40,breath away kind of throws right there
82:42,out of Nick Foles you think he's
82:44,confident look at this tiny little
82:46,window there's people all over this
82:48,throw
82:49,[Applause]
82:57,third and six
83:04,when it comes into the backfield
83:10,swinging him out bass goes up to the 23
83:14,yard line angle or breaks away and picks
83:17,up the first down and plenty more got
83:20,away from Johnson bad emotion for a gain
83:22,of 16 yards and it did not look like he
83:25,was going to pick it up Adam OC right
83:27,here is in perfect position he makes the
83:30,tackle there off the field he misses the
83:32,tackle
83:32,game on big miss missing tackles in the
83:38,open field on third down in a couple
83:45,tonight Bangalore poor catches 30 yards
83:54,what
83:56,back upfield taken down by Lauren sky
83:59,after again close to five yeah you have
84:04,all kinds of people on the outside
84:06,remember Kyle valiant anoi on the
84:08,beginning of the game now they put this
84:10,extra offensive lineman in there let's
84:12,go get an extra big body on them you
84:14,know you're gonna have to work the edges
84:16,of this New England Patriots defense now
84:19,a few extra big guys in there to try and
84:21,get that done
84:23,[Applause]
84:28,what stays in
84:32,he and a giant each carried six times
84:35,tonight
84:35,[Applause]
84:39,this way through breaking tackles again
84:42,takes the ball in to Patriot territory
84:44,to the 48 yard line Malcolm Brown makes
84:47,the tackle first down got to be able to
84:51,handle the nose tackle here it is
84:53,Jason Kelsey going up against Malcolm
84:56,Brown their best along that defensive
84:58,line and I've got to think that
85:01,something is going on with Jay edge I
85:04,had the ankle issue this week missed a
85:06,punch but he is back in there now here
85:09,he is six carries for 41 yards for him
85:14,lines up deep in the backfield fake
85:20,talks to him both fires low incomplete
85:23,Smith the intended receiver Chun
85:26,covering second down and 10 Butler's
85:32,still on the bench one of the stories
85:34,and again it was a coach's decision Bill
85:37,Belichick taking telling Michelle hey we
85:40,we put the players in we think the best
85:42,win the game for us go figure
85:44,the big hero three years ago with the
85:46,interception of Russell Wilson only
85:49,playing special teams tonight but also
85:51,remember he came off the bench to make
85:53,that play in that game yes he did
85:56,second down to ten
85:58,from the 49-yard line
86:02,[Applause]
86:03,swings to the outside starts the stubble
86:06,keeps his balance takes the ball to the
86:09,40-yard line the former dolphin sending
86:12,up a third down and one for Philly then
86:15,Xiang it is down Patrick Chung on his
86:19,knee territory calls for the training
86:23,staff that Chung one of the toughest
86:28,guys on this Patriots defense but let's
86:31,take a look at je je he has one of the
86:35,great jump cuts and then he just
86:37,finishes runs he has just been violent
86:40,at the end of runs it has been something
86:44,to watch this team since he's come over
86:46,what he's been able to do but this is a
86:48,big big loss right now for the New
86:50,England Patriots Chung out got pop
86:54,Wisniewski also limped off Isaac Santa
86:57,Malo goes into play left guard so you're
87:00,missing Philadelphia's they're starting
87:02,left guard Chung is out Jordan Richards
87:06,comes in to spell him 37 for the
87:09,Patriots and it's third down and one
87:15,Sam almost the extra line and chance
87:18,warm Mac enough comes in at left guard
87:20,and right now they have Stephon Gilmore
87:22,instead of playing his side is now
87:25,traveling everywhere with Al Sean
87:27,Jeffrey third and one
87:30,[Music]
87:33,make the blunt bold Swagger's down the
87:36,sideline caught first down Zach Ertz
87:41,having a nice night leading receiver on
87:44,a team this year at Deena 14 he's got
87:46,four for 47 play fake it hit the swing
87:50,Doug Peterson is unbelievable you know
87:54,every once in a while you see somebody
87:56,for the first time in a big moment and
87:58,you wonder okay he's been bowled all
88:00,year is he going to continue to play
88:02,that way if anything
88:04,Peterson's ramped it up a little bit
88:06,more Patricia with that familiar read
88:11,pull over
88:13,to coach of the Pistons within 48 hours
88:18,audience of course that was that was a
88:21,madman kumano news LeGarrette Blount to
88:24,the 22 yard line look at season tickets
88:28,of the bestest of sure he's hoping to
88:31,solve this thing because young Nick
88:33,Foles the story all week and the story
88:37,since the injury to Carson Wentz is good
88:40,he holed up emotionally could he play
88:44,against Tom Brady this has been some
88:46,showing by him so far in this one so
88:48,Wentz on the sidelines he hopes move
88:51,back to the start of training camp after
88:54,the knee injury second down and six
88:55,trips to the right
88:57,[Applause]
88:59,dancing around and throws that one out
89:05,of bounds for Burton the nearest to it
89:07,third and six member helman you know
89:10,morose the entire city of Philadelphia
89:12,was they want a huge game against the
89:15,Rams but they lose the guy who might
89:17,have been the MVP nobody really knows
89:19,what foals can do played well the next
89:21,week against the Giants not so well the
89:24,next two games were very well against
89:26,Atlanta and terrific against Minnesota
89:29,he's played in three playoff games this
89:31,being his fourth and he has been
89:33,tremendous and all of those have turned
89:36,the ball over put the kiss of death on
89:40,third down and six
89:47,in line does a good job the pass into
89:49,the end zone
89:51,is Cory Clement yes
89:54,touchdown
90:03,two officials check with each other back
90:05,to the end zone 22 yards on what was a
90:08,third down and six straight down the
90:11,field that's marquise flowers a four or
90:14,five sprinter out there on him and how
90:17,about how many times out do we come into
90:20,the Super Bowl and we say who is it
90:22,who's the unknown take a look here
90:26,starts to lose control and then that
90:30,left foot is clearly out of bounds but
90:37,did he get the left foot down first with
90:39,control takes it through the ground all
90:46,begins to wobble a bit the previous play
90:50,will be reviewed can you say
90:52,definitively this last step that's out
90:58,it's up definitely under review back
91:02,after this
91:03,[Music]
91:08,after review the ruling on the field
91:11,stands
91:16,augustin yeah we looked at that it looks
91:18,like if you know either way he begins to
91:21,lose control but he's got to get that
91:23,left foot down there they contend that
91:25,he has control here pinch it with his
91:28,arm starts to come out clearly the the
91:32,left foot the second time it came down
91:33,was out of bounds I give up yeah well I
91:37,mean I don't know I give up if that ball
91:40,is not loose in his arms when that last
91:42,foot came down I give up
91:46,Eliott for the extra point
91:50,so it stands on a third to sixth place
91:53,718 left in the third 29:19 Eagles
91:59,[Music]
92:01,temperature outside hovering around zero
92:04,all day long
92:06,nice and comfy in US Bank Stadium in
92:09,second year of existence following the
92:12,Minnesota Vikings
92:16,take what you get against the Patriots I
92:19,guess you bet
92:22,is going to be brought back the Lewis
92:28,brings it back out to the 25-yard line
92:31,back we go to the catch once more
92:33,question to me here's the question when
92:35,does he gain control of the football
92:37,when does this start does he have
92:40,control there I would argue know that
92:43,what steps out of bounds obviously close
92:50,call tough decision made in New York
92:54,actually made here hey Miriam tonight no
92:56,River on I would have called that
93:00,incomplete we've seen that called
93:02,incomplete I would say the majority of
93:04,time
93:05,from the 25-yard line
93:09,eight a one here put Dion Lewis taken
93:12,down by Mills it'll be second down and
93:15,nine when Matt Patricia watching his
93:20,defense pretty much getting shredded
93:24,it's 400 yards tonight two and a half
93:28,quarters gazelle bunch in mrs. Tom Brady
93:31,looking on wondering if her man has
93:35,another big comeback in him
93:38,which that would let be Man Bites Dog
93:41,news
93:44,rady grows and it's incomplete having to
93:47,adjust that it was Hogan covered there
93:49,by Cory Graham to get a flag down and a
93:56,little conference you with change
93:58,territory gonna hold it appears against
94:00,the defense
94:05,[Applause]
94:08,Michael Kendricks uncle Kendricks right
94:11,here watch the grab on the top in right
94:14,there and nobody can sell it like rock
94:16,have you seen him and you know he's a
94:19,big strong guy I do think he was
94:21,definitely held there I'm not saying
94:23,that but I'm just saying rock is the
94:25,best in the NFL it's selling those holes
94:28,it'd be done in an Oscar but probably a
94:29,Golden Globe
94:32,the Lewis the minute I tell you it's
94:37,amazing to watch how fast that defense
94:41,closes and Bill Belichick says my guys
94:44,that do this watch how this looks like
94:46,this is going to be one of those jump
94:48,cuts to the outside a little gap in
94:50,there and things just closed so fast
94:53,Vinny curry that time coming ripping off
94:56,the edge this equals defense now they're
94:59,not wearing down it's not happening the
95:01,way it did with the Atlanta Falcons
95:02,they're still on their toes and fresh
95:05,able to rotate seven guys in and out
95:08,second down and nine
95:11,great
95:13,and that is caught near midfield taken
95:15,in by Hogan Ronald Darby makes the
95:19,tackle and that moves the chains look
95:22,what happens for Tom Brady when he goes
95:25,to that play-action there is just nobody
95:28,underneath and he is so quick getting
95:30,that football out it's buying him that
95:32,extra tenth of a second and every Super
95:35,Bowl it seems like somebody becomes the
95:37,favor right and now it's beginning to
95:39,look like Chris Hogan is making some
95:40,plays for the game getting bounced down
95:45,there by Malcolm Jenkins there for a
95:49,gain of four second down and six
95:51,watch Malcolm Jenkins you want to know
95:53,why he's the leader of this football
95:54,team watch this play you're talking
95:56,about one of the toughest players in the
95:59,open field to tackle in Dion Lewis and
96:02,Malcolm Jenkins
96:03,has been making plays like that all
96:05,season he's been covering James White on
96:08,passes has made a big play on a run stop
96:10,when the Super Bowl has a rookie with
96:13,the Saints second down and seven
96:17,through the middle
96:19,nice little hole there and then stopping
96:21,in shy of the first down was Mills
96:24,setting up a third to Louis to the 44
96:30,Patriots one of those teams that don't
96:33,audible so much but they call two plays
96:35,in the huddle some and when you see Tom
96:38,Brady kind of give it the old I used to
96:40,say think about it look we're done that
96:43,means we want play number two now third
96:46,down one from the 45 yard line
96:51,seize that motion back in knows he has
96:53,man coverage
96:54,[Applause]
96:59,open inside the 30-yard line Danny
97:01,Amendola for a first down as the clock
97:04,ticks down under four minutes to go in
97:06,the third
97:07,soon as he knew it was man coverage goes
97:10,right to Amendola but this motion James
97:12,White comes back inside and Malcolm
97:15,Jenkins who's played him a man coverage
97:17,all day goes with him so Brady knows at
97:19,that point he's going to his best man
97:21,coverage option and there it was Danny
97:24,Amendola 377 passing yards for the 40
97:30,year old one
97:34,first down to the end zone caught
97:37,touchdown Hogan
97:43,chris hogan from 26 get position on
97:47,Macleod to turn it back into a one
97:49,possession game this is just
97:52,unbelievable offensive football you're
97:55,gonna see Hogan is going to work to the
97:58,outside and then back in what a patient
98:00,rout this is this is a veteran player
98:03,understanding he has time he understands
98:06,that tom brady is going to sit there
98:08,look off the free safety get him back in
98:11,the middle of field and this is turning
98:13,into fast-break basketball out here
98:18,viscosity for the extra point
98:22,three and a half to go in the third and
98:25,Tom Brady is already thrown for 403
98:28,yards
98:32,29:26 needles
98:35,[Music]
98:35,[Applause]
98:40,[Music]
98:43,it's the Super Bowl so of course you've
98:45,got to quench the funny Blake Shelton
98:48,here tonight left on the right and the
98:51,left on the right Floyd Mayweather Jimmy
98:55,Fallon Bradley Cooper longtime Eagle fan
99:01,yes - Jeff flurry what a game we are
99:05,seeing 29 to 26 Philadelphia just asked
99:09,me to kick it away
99:14,we're deep down in the end zone
99:16,or a touchback 3:23 left in the third
99:19,and eighth
99:20,three-point game in Super Bowl 50 to
99:22,[Applause]
99:24,they going to snap it and it's trade
99:28,bird new things caught fools
99:31,touchdown how do you figure this play
99:35,call has a chance to people remember it
99:37,is one of the all-time greats they win
99:41,the game and it will be 55 total points
99:45,still have 18 minutes of regulation to
99:47,play over 900 yards of total offense in
99:51,the game cheongun was new skee-bowl
99:54,injured on the last series or bolt back
99:57,in the game Jay Ajayi starts as the
100:04,running back
100:08,puts it in the stomach and throws to the
100:10,sideline fold in along the sideline by
100:13,Akal or perfect throw nice catch first
100:18,down
100:18,d 2:24 this is another great adjustment
100:21,here by Peterson because you end up with
100:23,everybody thinks that RPO those run pass
100:28,options that you're going to throw
100:29,slants so what have we see tonight just
100:32,the opposite the Patriots line up a bit
100:35,inside to take away those slants and
100:36,then Nick Foles goes to the other option
100:39,that fade from the inside position
100:42,Peterson and I can really come up with a
100:44,great play of the night
100:46,tell you what though we have not heard
100:48,much from Alshon Jeffery since they made
100:50,the move and put Stephon Gilmore on him
100:54,got three early on
100:57,buyers caught over the middle Laurie
100:59,Smith gets free down the seam and takes
101:01,the ball to the 33-yard line
101:03,tackle thereby Devin McCourty first down
101:06,one more time
101:08,just that RPO action and you could see
101:10,that nick foles since he started running
101:13,this play about two games ago as the
101:16,playoff started his comfort level and
101:19,his confidence has just shot through the
101:21,roof I don't think I'll ever get over
101:23,what he did against the number one
101:24,Minnesota Vikings defense two weeks ago
101:27,and now he's doing it to the Patriots
101:28,shredded them
101:31,two minutes to the end of the period
101:35,to the outside taken down tonight big
101:37,Malcom Brown number 98 for a gain of two
101:40,it'll be second down and eight where
101:41,Malcolm Brown is so good what a great
101:43,battle that is with he and Jason Kelsey
101:46,going at it inside in the middle but
101:48,Malcolm Brown has long been the
101:51,centerpiece to me of this defensive line
101:55,he has the quickness Kelsey is quick but
101:58,he just fought through the inside gap
101:59,there and made the play and Wisniewski
102:02,back in the game as well
102:05,at the 32-second Anani
102:09,runningback is Clement
102:14,and around
102:16,galore
102:17,it's on us to get the first down is very
102:19,close they'll give it to it the 23 yard
102:22,line he's tackle ear by Eric row now we
102:26,had not seen much of Nelson a galore on
102:30,these reverse plays during the course of
102:33,the regular season but since the last
102:35,game of the regular season and into the
102:37,playoffs he has three four five of those
102:40,plays now and they have been picking up
102:42,some big first downs most total yards in
102:50,Super Bowl history already with over 15
102:53,minutes to play 955 total yards
102:58,Behr's goes to the endzone and
103:02,incomplete that a couple receivers down
103:04,he had Burton and hurts both tight ends
103:07,34 seconds now and it's second down and
103:10,10 tell you who continues to impress me
103:13,in this game and that's Patrick Chong I
103:15,really felt like the two tight ends
103:17,would be such a factor in this ball game
103:20,and one of the unknowns was Trey Burke
103:22,who really is an excellent route runner
103:25,we know what Zach Ertz can do but for
103:27,the most part Patrick Chung has had a
103:29,good feel for both those guys we thought
103:33,Burton would play a bigger role in the
103:34,game but he has thrown a touchdown pass
103:36,oh than that case you forgot
103:40,[Music]
103:43,second and ten
103:46,to Smith on the outside and step on
103:49,there gets take him down by McCourty
103:56,third down back to the trick play now
103:59,yeah you know what made this so
104:00,interesting was when they went to the
104:02,direct snap on fourth and one I thought
104:04,Clement was going to just run power off
104:07,tackle or something and then there was a
104:10,circus after that what a well
104:12,orchestrated play
104:14,I just tucked Peterson has so much guts
104:18,death in that situation that's right off
104:20,the street
104:20,[Applause]
104:23,waning seconds of the quarter third down
104:26,and three and they're going to run it
104:31,out that's the end of the quarter so we
104:33,played three exciting quarters fill it
104:35,up in twenty nine to England twenty six
104:37,Super Bowl fifty two resilient to these
104:41,messages from your local station
104:43,[Music]
104:46,live shots two of the great support
104:48,cities in the country Philadelphia and
104:50,Boston Al Michaels with Cris
104:52,Collinsworth and Michele Tafoya start
104:55,the fourth quarter Philadelphia filled
104:57,bastard 99 years old Eagle fans since
105:01,they first started play in 1933 he said
105:06,I thought if I ever live to a hundred I
105:08,don't see this kind
105:09,[Applause]
105:12,so here we go 15 minutes of regulation
105:15,left its third down and three and foals
105:19,are swinging it and getting blasted
105:21,right now Marquis flowers it's Nelson a
105:25,galore to make it fourth down it's
105:28,really a great job by flowers it look
105:30,like one of those motions but he's gonna
105:32,stop and go back out and then flowers
105:34,it's going to come up and recognize what
105:37,was going on
105:38,so let's just give him credit his speed
105:40,able to get out and make that play
105:42,that's a loss of eight turns it into a
105:48,43 make it a 42-yard field goal attempt
105:52,now
105:53,[Applause]
105:57,Jake Dehlia longest building made by a
106:00,rookie
106:02,in the Superbowl he would break that
106:06,Doug's inside the right upright so just
106:11,a few seconds into the fourth with a
106:13,flag down down there's a flag down that
106:21,was a 4th down and 11
106:23,now looks like it's against the Patriots
106:25,Assad defense number 94 that penalty is
106:30,declined his older to play successful
106:33,field goal timeout
106:35,take those points off for the fourth and
106:37,six six point game
106:41,[Music]
106:41,[Applause]
106:43,[Music]
106:44,some team will win some nice jewelry
106:48,tonight as we take a look at most Super
106:50,Bowl wins the Steelers have won six did
106:54,that end a 34 year period and the 49ers
106:57,won five along with the Dallas Cowboys
107:01,the Patriots also with five trying to
107:06,make it six in 17 years
107:08,the Steelers won their six in twice as
107:11,many years 34 touch back here and New
107:14,England will begin its next drive from
107:16,the 25-yard line last two Super Bowls
107:22,against Seattle and Laster of course on
107:25,overtime
107:26,370 yards 127 rating you know we've said
107:31,it before
107:32,father time has no idea where Tom Brady
107:35,lives none none and the other part of it
107:38,is no sacs in this game at all now we've
107:42,seen the Philadelphia Eagles they got
107:44,some pressure in the first half on a
107:46,pretty consistent basis but they didn't
107:49,finish him off you have to finish off
107:54,bring out our sister on of handing it
107:56,off to Birkhead the former Cincinnati
107:59,bingo
108:00,pick them up in the offseason picks up
108:02,six here they get second down let's call
108:05,it the second and five you know five and
108:09,the other thing that Tom Brady has done
108:10,so effectively here in this ball game so
108:13,far is take advantage of those
108:15,aggressive linebackers 43 percent of
108:18,these passes down the first three
108:19,quarters off play action Burkett again
108:23,up to the 40-yard line they mix and
108:26,match them and there's so many guys who
108:27,can do so many things get a whole bunch
108:29,of Swiss Army knives running backs guys
108:33,on defense multiple rolls
108:35,nice double-team on the outside right
108:38,out here watch as nate solder gets the
108:41,double team that gets up to the next
108:43,level and takes care of nigel Brattle
108:48,[Applause]
108:50,lady from the 39
108:51,[Applause]
108:57,good one here picks the five tackle here
109:00,by Jean Lynn Mills second down just when
109:03,you think you know what the New England
109:05,Patriots are going to do they come out
109:08,and start running the football Rex
109:10,Burkhead has really been known as much
109:13,as a receiver when he got in the game
109:15,remember him against the Denver Broncos
109:16,we saw them played so great out there
109:19,catching passes so let's see if they're
109:21,setting the hook here just a little bit
109:23,and start looking for Burkett as a
109:25,receiver those three runs on the last
109:28,three plays his only runs of the night
109:31,keep them in with a fullback Develin
109:33,swing it out quick bit of Hogan nice
109:35,catch there
109:37,[Applause]
109:38,the stuffing well short of the first
109:40,down it's amazing what that field-goal
109:45,felt like in that last Drive it felt
109:48,like a huge success for the New England
109:50,Patriots I mean that's the way this game
109:52,has been going and now Jim Schwartz
109:54,needs to return the favor on this third
109:57,down
109:59,he has not blitz very much at all and
110:01,when he did he got burned I don't
110:03,expected here
110:04,three receivers set to the left
110:09,white is in the backfield with salmon
110:11,Dola hello there
110:13,[Applause]
110:17,that cans it for a first down run out by
110:20,Jaylon Mills converting on a third down
110:24,nobody does this better right here when
110:27,they put Amendola in motion and you see
110:30,jaylen Mills go across with him right
110:32,now right now Tom Brady knows exactly
110:35,where he's going to throw the ball his
110:37,best receiver in the clutch in the big
110:40,moments in the fourth quarter Danny
110:43,Amendola
110:45,Burak head back in
110:48,open at the 30-yard line
110:50,Amendola again Danny Amendola and the
110:54,ball comes out but the play was whistled
110:56,dead MacLeod is there and an offensive
111:03,lineman fabulous job yeah no question
111:06,look at how quickly Nate's older got out
111:09,there on Barnet and that gave Tom Brady
111:11,plenty of time even though there was
111:13,some pressure he just casually steps up
111:16,and now they're starting to do that
111:17,play-action pass against a single high
111:19,safety where a module is going across
111:22,the formation and because the protection
111:24,is there Brady's went in the bat he's
111:28,barely even touched tonight swings it
111:31,out here
111:33,that's going to set up the first down
111:35,and gold you know it's funny Chris we
111:38,both know that the Giants won those two
111:40,Super Bowls because of all of the
111:42,pressure they were able to put on brady
111:43,sir he's talking about the philadelphia
111:45,can do that with their four guys but
111:47,they haven't tonight they haven't and
111:49,they have it at least in part because of
111:50,the pace the pace just wears defense is
111:54,out it doesn't give you a chance to get
111:55,said it doesn't give you a chance to run
111:57,exotic looks
111:58,and brady is seeing everything
112:00,everything whatever you show them he
112:03,takes it and extrapolates it out and
112:05,makes it into a big play no sacs for
112:08,either team in the game 2nd down and 1
112:15,the first down taking it to the three
112:17,goes James white down to ten minutes in
112:23,the fourth quarter we saw it in the
112:25,Super Bowl last year but when Tom Brady
112:27,can get a game into the fourth quarter
112:29,of all those sacks all those pressures
112:32,all those hits start to go away because
112:35,the defense wears down a bit and I think
112:37,it's even happening to Philadelphia I
112:39,didn't think it would but the interior
112:41,pressure of these tremendous football
112:43,players Fletcher Cox Brandon Graham Tim
112:46,Jernigan all those guys in there they've
112:49,been non factors against breaker
112:50,ninth play of the drive
112:57,it's a low throw and it is incomplete
113:01,said therefore James white you say boy
113:06,that was a low throw but in reality is
113:09,exactly what Tom wanted to do only his
113:11,guy has a chance at this ball just one
113:14,hop in there but there's no way he was
113:16,going to give those two defenders a
113:18,chance for it you miss it low no big
113:20,deal come back here on second down
113:22,second and goal over a thousand yards
113:25,and total offense tonight 567 for the
113:30,Patriots
113:38,and Brady lost Slough Ekron Kowski
113:41,reaching for touchdown
113:48,they look unstoppable right now
113:52,and New England has its first lead of
113:55,the game Gronkowski beats Darby for the
113:58,touchdown one more time a Levin dolet
114:02,goes across the formation and what does
114:05,that do at signals man coverage and you
114:07,know you have Gronkowski with a tight
114:09,split being able to go to the fade route
114:12,and the corner of the endzone against a
114:14,much smaller cornerback and Ronald Darby
114:17,it's a chess game and they will have
114:19,their first lead of the game if they
114:21,make the extra point but tonight you
114:25,don't know yeah and we plenty of Drive
114:27,these kickers look a little unsteady on
114:31,both of these logos in the middle of the
114:33,field apparently there were some issues
114:35,for these kickers and there were a lot
114:38,of people out inspecting that area
114:40,before the game so we'll see yeah there
114:43,it is
114:45,fifty-two logo boy that can get in
114:50,so the extra point to give
114:54,New England its first lead of the game
115:00,puts it down and the Patriots on top
115:07,33:32 Mrs Brady happy
115:10,with a spike
115:18,well the most valuable player voting is
115:21,now open go to nfl.com slash MVP or the
115:24,NFL app on your mobile device and you
115:27,can vote for the Super Bowl 50 to MVP
115:31,kind of idea who might be in front at
115:34,the moment win or lose well just a Tilo
115:38,minute at the 33 32 it normally goes to
115:42,somebody on the winning side a lot of
115:44,football to be played 922 left in
115:47,regulation that's the mantra do your job
115:51,[Applause]
116:00,somewhere over there somebody has to
116:01,make a play one turnover one sack one
116:04,something
116:06,[Applause]
116:10,won't be here because the touchback will
116:12,take it out to the 25-yard line
116:16,dante's Carnegie is gonna turn 70 he had
116:19,retired they bring him back to run the
116:22,offensive line one of the great
116:24,assistant coaches in recent NFL history
116:27,there's a lot of greatness associated
116:30,with the Patriots I'm not sure that
116:32,guy's name is quite as well-known as
116:34,everybody else's but when he left the
116:36,Patriots were a different team when he
116:38,came back the Patriots were what we're
116:40,seeing the night trying to win
116:42,back-to-back Super Bowl is final in
116:44,three
116:44,the last four Jaya jockey is the running
116:48,back fill up he begins the stock from
116:50,the 25-yard line
116:50,[Applause]
116:59,play clock at 1:00
117:02,a jockey
117:04,bangs his way up to the 29 yard line
117:07,Heena for second down and six McCord Ian
117:10,on the tackle
117:11,now anytime you watch duck Peterson's
117:14,play cause he takes advantage of two
117:16,great athletes on this offensive line
117:19,Jason Kelsey at center Lane Johnson
117:21,you'll see those two guys pulling
117:23,misdirecting leading the way on so many
117:26,of these run plays tremendous athletes
117:29,playing up front
117:31,[Applause]
117:33,Johnny stays in second down and six
117:42,Bulls buying time we feel one-on-one
117:46,adjusting but incomplete Torrey Smith
117:49,and Eric rolled one on one down field
117:52,that's going to make it third down and
117:53,six with eight and a half to go James
117:57,Harris ends a guy they're going to get
117:58,the education from but I have to say
118:00,Paula Poole avati vitai on the outside
118:04,for the Philadelphia Eagles has grown as
118:06,much in the last month as any player I
118:09,have seen in a long long time
118:11,yes Harrison got him a little bit there
118:14,but that young man right
118:16,his game around and he replaced the
118:19,all-pro Jason Peters when he went down
118:21,with an injury at the midpoint of the
118:23,season third and six
118:26,and what's the Lee for the snow first
118:36,charge timeout New England New England
118:41,takes a timeout timeout sir precious but
118:48,whatever it was they wanted to get the
118:51,the right personnel the right scheme in
118:53,there take it now third down and six up
118:57,coming yeah that's one that whatever
119:00,reason they probably got stuck in man
119:02,coverage and didn't like what they were
119:04,looking at and didn't want to give this
119:06,one up pick it off the field here the
119:07,way that Tom Brady in this offense is
119:09,going you have to think the Eagles have
119:11,problems we haven't seen them stop them
119:13,yet no 21 points for New England in the
119:17,second hand I'd say Alshon Jeffery needs
119:21,a place Stephon Gilmore has tied him
119:25,since he's made the move out there
119:28,they empty the backfield ago 4x1
119:31,both fires over the middle and that is
119:33,caught big first down they all become
119:36,big right now Zach Ertz makes the catch
119:39,first down they played the lurk coverage
119:42,they had a lot of coverage in the middle
119:44,of the field with the second slant
119:47,in goes out and then back in they drew
119:50,that working coverage in the middle of
119:53,field away and gave herds the chance for
119:55,the one-on-one Falls 315 yards through
120:00,the air tonight
120:05,walk back in
120:07,[Applause]
120:10,give it up 9
120:15,clue about the 39-yard line second down
120:19,and eight well you do not see the
120:23,Garrett Blount go backwards like that
120:25,very often that was some play coming
120:27,down the line wasn't sure exactly who it
120:29,was but format Patricia that now gives
120:32,him a chance
120:33,break down the line and there we go
120:37,that's Lawrence guy the one guy we
120:40,haven't heard a whole lot from tonight
120:42,is Trey flowers and I would have said is
120:44,he along with Malcolm Brown where their
120:46,two best along that front seven agreed
120:48,talking about a guy with two and a half
120:50,sacks against Matt Ryan and last year's
120:54,Super Bowl
120:55,Clement is the running back play fake
120:57,balls drops it off underneath to him
121:00,Clement tries to charge his way to her
121:03,first times that we stopped a little
121:04,short for the moment shun it able to
121:08,prevent the first down to make it third
121:10,down and one one of the really
121:13,underappreciated parts of the New
121:14,England Patriots in this secondary is
121:16,their ability to tackle in the open
121:19,field some teams don't practice that so
121:21,much I'm almost always amazed early in
121:24,the season you will see these safeties
121:26,having to make those open field tackles
121:29,time after time and they made it in a
121:31,big moment right there in the Super Bowl
121:33,third and one with a jaw and the
121:35,backfield Smith in motion
121:42,vast caught on the outside by Smith but
121:44,he cannot get to the line to gain
121:48,McCourty with the tackle and it's 4th
121:52,down big play there by James Harrison
121:55,they were in trouble the veteran saw
121:57,this thing coming across and got just
121:59,enough of Torrey Smith here to give his
122:01,coverage a chance to get across the
122:03,field and the court he able to make the
122:06,tackle but that was all James Harrison
122:08,what a heads-up play veteran play right
122:10,there from the moment they're going to
122:11,leave the offense on the field do you
122:13,dare after well duck Peterson
122:16,you've got 548 picking down the ball is
122:20,at the 45 it's 4th and 1 the play clock
122:22,is down to 4
122:26,and they go for it and folds under
122:29,pressure throws caught just enough for
122:32,the first down
122:33,Zach Ertz forward progress Nets him the
122:37,first with five and a half to go nice
122:41,pick play inside those big tight ends
122:43,working together on that one two tight
122:46,ends on the left and Earths coming
122:48,around the other way
122:49,one of the most dependable pass catchers
122:52,in the National Football League didn't
122:54,drop a pass all season and when they
122:57,needed it most he hangs on six catches
123:00,56 yards for him where you have to start
123:05,paying a little bit of attention to the
123:06,clock now to under five minutes to play
123:14,and a whistle here at a time out for the
123:20,Eagles
123:21,[Music]
123:26,might be set up for a fantastic finish
123:29,for 52 remaining in regulation it's a
123:33,one-point game Eagles at their own 47
123:37,yard line now you know what was
123:40,interesting by going for it on fourth
123:42,down there the duck Petersen you'd
123:44,almost prefer to a given New England the
123:46,shorter field even they score a
123:48,touchdown it's an eight-point game right
123:50,and you're still spin it back you
123:51,couldn't have them bleed the clock this
123:53,is crazy for the Philadelphia Eagles
123:56,obviously best case scenario now
123:58,establish a running game milk the clock
124:00,a little bit but you can't imagine a
124:02,scenario where Tom Brady's not getting
124:04,this back
124:04,Peterson knows no fear we've seen that
124:08,in evidence
124:08,[Applause]
124:10,blunt is the running back the gathering
124:12,one into a lot of traffic into the yard
124:16,the two little shining of the first time
124:18,second and long but that really gives
124:21,you some options now Matt Patricia the
124:24,defensive coordinator to make that first
124:27,down run stop now you have everything on
124:31,the table James Harrison the old wily
124:36,veteran out there on the left-hand side
124:37,does he have one trick up his sleeve
124:39,we've seen him with some late moment
124:43,success late in games to win them with
124:46,big sacks
124:49,[Applause]
124:58,caught and staying in bounces galore and
125:01,that will move the chains covered by
125:03,Chung good catch
125:05,James Harrison was coming off the edge
125:08,and Nick Foles had no choice he had to
125:11,escape get out but he has made these
125:14,throws on the run tonight Harrison now
125:17,starting to size up by ty with this bull
125:20,rush just get ready he's going to give
125:22,him a changeup he's gonna grab that
125:24,outside arm and benefit and will say
125:28,I've seen this changeup before from the
125:32,43
125:39,four-man rush those spiders caught over
125:43,the middle to the 22 goes Nelson a
125:46,galore another first down I just can't
125:51,tell you how impressed I am with Nick
125:52,Foles and what he's doing he stared
125:55,right down the barrel there was another
125:57,tiny little window to get that one in
125:59,with plenty of coverage all around it
126:02,and yet Nick Foles just continues to
126:05,play like he's been doing this his
126:07,entire life battling against the likes
126:10,of Tom Brady meanwhile Chung is down on
126:13,one knee for an injury timeout Tory
126:20,Falls and little Lily at seven months
126:24,old with the hitch set on playing with
126:28,one of the toys there and there is dad
126:31,with 307 what a night he has had 352
126:37,yards a thousand 81 yards tonight so far
126:42,most in any NFL postseason game ever
126:47,Nick Foles went ask questions about his
126:50,wife and child this week got choked up
126:52,and couldn't finish the answer
126:56,is byrock my wife matric Zhang is out
127:01,Johnson bad emotion stays in Armand it's
127:06,safety now on first down
127:10,they stopped by Harmon
127:12,first you know what's so great about
127:14,this game is that the game has been
127:16,terrific and start to finish I mean last
127:18,year people say well great Super Bowl
127:19,over time I was twenty eight to three
127:21,the game has been relentless just
127:25,relentlessly Nazz great as the halftime
127:28,entertainment was and it was fantastic
127:31,this game has been as good as Justin
127:35,Timberlake start to finish
127:36,only one punt all night very few
127:41,penalties as well that was a big force
127:44,out of bounds right there though 237
127:48,[Applause]
127:49,at the 14 yard line
127:51,[Applause]
127:54,Jokke backing up its the ball down of
127:57,the 12 yard line
127:59,and the Patriots are going to take a
128:01,timeout so they've not taken to they
128:04,have one left plus the two-minute
128:05,warning
128:06,which makes everything on the table here
128:10,let's say that they go down inside and
128:15,get inside for a first down
128:19,we things start to get really
128:21,interesting from there because of that
128:23,lost time out early in the half by the
128:25,Patriots but how much time you really
128:29,need for Brady to work his magic again
128:34,anyway first thinks for a second down
128:36,and seven with the ball now at the 11
128:39,yard line depends on when the first down
128:41,happens yep
128:43,Clement in the backfield
128:46,big night for him 100 receiving yards
128:51,take it to them go to the end zone and
128:53,then it's incomplete little pushing and
128:56,shoving there without Sean Jeffrey the
128:59,intended receiver covered by Gilmore
129:01,Commons roommate second third down and
129:03,seven this has been the story right
129:06,there Gilmore has been fantastic they
129:09,did not start the game with Gilmore
129:11,following Jeffery he made a few big
129:13,plays made the touchdown they've
129:15,switched back and he is taken over the
129:19,game on the outside
129:21,huge play here of course they could take
129:23,the lead with a field goal to get a
129:25,touchdown almost certainly go to to try
129:28,to make a seven-point game
129:30,first things first third down in seven
129:32,from the 12 fact works out why
129:36,limit flares out to the right to the end
129:40,zone Zach Ertz for the touchdown and
129:44,again all you can think back to now is
129:46,the Jesse James play with Miss purring
129:49,does he complete the process
129:52,I don't know that ball comes loose he
129:55,does catch it but at what point is it
129:59,loose on the ground gets inside McCourty
130:02,who stumbles ball pops out I'm not even
130:08,taking a guess no
130:13,it
130:16,as he was rolling over it looked like
130:20,that's when the vault does he control it
130:24,when it gets off the ground there is
130:26,[Applause]
130:30,does the ball actually make contact with
130:33,the ground he has control of it here
130:42,all pops out
130:45,al river on is the head of officiating
130:51,he's I you know I'm sure it Pittsburgh V
130:57,going are you kidding me if they call
130:59,Jesse James back what are they gonna do
131:01,with this one I think they have to
131:03,overturn it now the question was was he
131:05,a runner was he going to the ground in
131:07,the process of the catch if he were a
131:11,runner and crosses the line and dives
131:15,that would have been a touchdown but if
131:17,he's still a receiver going to the
131:18,ground in the process of the catch I
131:20,think this is incomplete yep
131:23,if i had to guess i say it's gonna get
131:25,overturned his drive again with 922 on
131:27,the clock
131:28,taking off seven minutes now if it gets
131:30,overturned it's gonna make it fourth
131:33,down and in all likelihood the field
131:38,goal unity comes in I cannot wait for
131:44,them to change this rule hopefully by
131:48,the end of the game oh my goodness that
131:51,is so close because he had control on
131:55,the ground for a second and then he
131:57,rolled over and then it popped up so was
132:00,it the ground that popped it up or did
132:02,he just lose control of it well you knew
132:05,that the catch no catch think was going
132:07,to rear its ugly head before this night
132:09,was done
132:15,the question in my mind was was he going
132:18,to the ground in the part of the catch
132:24,if they rule him a runner it stays as a
132:28,touch now the whole thing is love him a
132:30,runner at this point move and that they
132:34,call him a runner he he breaks the plane
132:36,as a runner if if that if it stays
132:38,that's gonna be the reason I think he
132:41,was running and diving for the end zone
132:44,but what constitutes going to the ground
132:47,it's always close it's subjective but
132:50,it's always if you're a runner it's one
132:52,thing if you receive it it's another
132:55,thing if they rule that he was a runner
132:58,it's gonna stand the receiver possesses
133:03,the football becomes a runner breaks the
133:05,plane of the goal line the ruling is
133:07,confirmed it is a touch
133:13,they have to go for two Julie Earth's
133:17,soccer star just watched her husband get
133:21,into the endzone there we go well we
133:25,know what their first two point
133:27,conversion play was it's the reverse
133:29,they scored the touchdown on the best of
133:32,holes you know they have at least three
133:34,in their hip pocket we're gonna see
133:36,number two right here
133:43,2:21 and a five-point game right now
133:46,that man will be back shortly
133:50,firstly comes a motion to the inside
133:54,those
133:56,it's incomplete Jennifer Clement he was
134:00,covered there by they annoy so it
134:03,remains a five-point game it's good play
134:08,here by a van hoy he's made a few
134:11,tonight forced him up underneath and
134:13,didn't give a real angle for poles to
134:15,make this play here poles look back for
134:19,his inside receiver that option not
134:21,there and just took a shot
134:23,little early contact on that one
134:28,[Applause]
134:29,[Music]
134:32,was he a runner would he have gone to
134:35,the ground
134:37,there was contact
134:39,[Applause]
134:44,in the process of that play if McCourty
134:48,wasn't there when earth's have been
134:51,going to the ground that's a hard call
134:53,berry but they rule them a runner at
134:56,that point and Nicole stands
135:00,you knew there would be something crazy
135:02,at the end you knew it always and now
135:05,guess what Tom Brady with to 21 months
135:09,will have a month to 21 the two-minute
135:12,warning and a timeout he's got all day
135:15,[Applause]
135:17,three possessions for New England in
135:19,this half all three have resulted in
135:22,touchdowns 11 game winning drives fourth
135:30,quarter or overtime five in other words
135:33,all of the games that he has won the
135:36,Super Bowl games he is one he's had a
135:38,comeback does he make it a half
135:43,three-straight 75-yard drives for Tom
135:46,Brady for touchdowns
135:53,why in the backfield
135:54,[Applause]
136:01,starts with the pass to the outside
136:03,Gronkowski and you will step out of
136:06,bounds wladim stops the clock Brady and
136:11,Gronkowski over Crockett had only one
136:14,catch for nine yards in the first half
136:16,whole different story here missed the
136:19,early seam and then just got hot really
136:22,took over any time it was brought
136:25,one-on-one the ball was going to him
136:28,just as it does in all big situations
136:31,and I am
136:34,second and two
136:38,Oh Randy gets hit the ball is out and
136:42,Philadelphia has it
136:46,comes away with it
136:50,Brandon Graham was one of the guys who
136:52,got in there
136:56,and it's the England's only turnover of
136:59,the game and it's the first sack of the
137:02,game just like the New York Giants back
137:06,in the day taking an outside pass rusher
137:10,and Brandon Graham and putting him
137:12,inside against the guard shack mason
137:15,pays huge dividends with the first sack
137:20,fumble of the game no question that ball
137:24,is out
137:27,that stands absolutely no question the
137:31,rookie Barnett their number one pick out
137:33,of Tennessee
137:34,[Applause]
137:39,so 209 New England has a time out the
137:43,clock can stop twice they can take a
137:45,timeout you could also have the
137:47,two-minute warning they can limit
137:50,throw it off into a field goal it would
137:53,still be a one-possession game it would
137:55,be eight points New England will be out
137:56,of timeouts
137:57,2:09 go up the 31 yard line
138:02,[Applause]
138:04,keep it on the ground make them take the
138:06,time out LeGarrette Blount to the 28
138:10,yard line
138:10,203 that took six seconds and there's
138:13,your final timeout it will stop once
138:15,more at the two-minute warning Brandon
138:19,Graham has been their best all season at
138:22,getting pressure here he goes from the
138:25,defensive tackle position ordinarily he
138:28,plays outside they have been working him
138:30,more and more on the inside for that
138:33,very reason get your best pass rushers
138:36,on the field that allowed Chris long to
138:39,get on the field Barnett on the other
138:41,side and it has been so frustrating all
138:45,night long for this Philadelphia Eagles
138:47,defense and yet with everything on the
138:50,line they finally get to Brady
138:54,[Applause]
138:55,Nick Foles on the sideline
138:58,Brady checking the replay I've seen this
139:02,movie too many times to think this game
139:04,is Oh
139:06,second seven
139:09,[Music]
139:10,[Applause]
139:13,and still charging is LeGarrette Blount
139:16,so that takes us to the two-minute
139:18,warning it comes with officially 156
139:20,it'll be third down and five on the
139:23,other side of the break it's Super Bowl
139:26,52
139:30,[Music]
139:38,one Michigan Wolverine on the left the
139:42,other on the right
139:43,Graham creeks the turnover Brady gives
139:46,it up here it is again
139:48,I tell you Brandon Graham has a
139:51,reputation of relentless effort and
139:57,we're playing the Patriots this is not
139:59,over
140:00,he was in the movie business you're
140:02,right he's seen this movie before - now
140:04,do you have the guts to throw it one
140:06,more time or you just taking that clock
140:08,third down and five
140:10,but Peterson calls here keep it on the
140:13,ground give it to Blount and stuff him
140:15,at the 28 yard line
140:16,so that's buggered now they can take the
140:18,clock all the way down to a little over
140:21,a minute and try to make it an
140:24,eight-point game for the field goal
140:28,attempt yeah well the field goal with a
140:29,rookie kicker and Jake Elliott you miss
140:32,it you're gonna place the ball out
140:34,around the 35 yard line something like
140:37,that and turning it over to Brady with a
140:40,chance to win how much pressure could be
140:42,on this kick for Jay Kelly and this
140:45,rookie kicker in his second game as an
140:47,Eagle picked the 61 yarder at the gun to
140:50,beat the Giants back in week 3 Peterson
140:56,says take the clock all the way down and
140:57,take the timeout right here
140:59,was 70 seconds
141:03,there it is the Lombardi Trophy does it
141:10,make its way to Broad Street the main
141:14,drag in Philadelphia they have had some
141:17,parties for championships there but I
141:20,don't I've been around Philadelphia
141:21,football fans this might be the biggest
141:24,one of all they bring this thing home
141:26,this is the capper I mean the Phillies
141:28,and the Flyers and the 76ers all had big
141:31,time for raids this would be the camera
141:35,you can assume nothing here the snap
141:38,y'all hole
141:40,you know whatever pad whatever rush the
141:43,page
141:44,see it right here 46 yard of ten Nevada
141:48,to snap it Donnie Jones to hold it
141:52,is good pic time
141:57,sixty-five seconds
142:01,so brainy has to get it all the way down
142:03,the field and then a two-point
142:05,conversion just cannot imagine the
142:10,amount of pressure and to rotate that
142:12,ball with the laces straight back we saw
142:14,that in a playoff game before and a
142:17,missed field goal to calmly spin those
142:19,laces around and give the young rookie a
142:22,free swing at it it's a great job by J
142:25,Kelly up a nice job by Donnie Jones to
142:30,41 to 33 Robert craft his team has gone
142:39,to nine Super Bowls it's astounding this
142:44,one same situation right it's last year
142:46,they needed eight if they go down they
142:49,score they get the two-point conversion
142:50,they went in an overtime
142:56,so Eliot
142:58,to kickoff
143:01,Dion Lewis and here he's a guy we saw
143:03,him on a Sunday night in Denver run one
143:07,back for a touchdown and this is
143:09,returnable from the six yard line
143:11,he's gonna flip it back to Birkhead but
143:15,he's gonna get wrapped up and knocked
143:17,down back at the 7 yard line that is a
143:21,really interesting call you go for the
143:25,home run shot I'd guess but that play
143:27,almost took the ball right out of Tom
143:29,Brady's hands come with the reverse back
143:33,to you the way short kick gave them an
143:34,opportunity but old baby yep
143:38,I think he took several seconds off the
143:40,clock as well I think that was part of
143:43,the reason they kicked it short they
143:44,wanted that clock running so from the 9
143:48,he's got to go 91 yards and convert a
143:51,two pointer
143:53,and Brady begins by slinging one to an
143:56,open receiver and that's Hogan but he
143:58,can't make the catch
143:59,got free down the sideline second down
144:03,just along with a little pressure here
144:05,on this one and the significance now of
144:09,being able to protect the boundaries
144:11,we've seen that in the playoffs with
144:14,Stefan Dix play you need to keep them in
144:17,bounds now because it's going to be very
144:19,difficult to get up there and give that
144:21,next play going for its long son of
144:23,Howie trying to win back-to-back Super
144:25,Bowls that it with the Patriots last
144:27,year second and ten
144:32,rady under pressure flushed out snags it
144:35,across his body an incomplete intended
144:37,therefore James White it'll be third
144:40,down and ten it was Derek Barnett
144:41,putting the pressure on I can remember
144:46,in the Super Bowl
144:48,oh can he remember which one it was now
144:50,but there was a play at the end of it
144:52,where Brady was sort of in this
144:53,situation he was against the Giants he
144:56,sort of walked right look right
144:57,pump-fake moved a little bit right and
145:00,then threw a go route back across
145:03,Randy Moss freaking down here and it was
145:06,close that that was the first game
145:09,against the Giants Brady now under
145:14,pressure almost gets sat in complete
145:17,pocket collapsed they're down to their
145:20,last plays of trying to keep it going
145:23,forth intent
145:24,Fletcher Cox finally with the pressure
145:27,that made a difference of these big guys
145:29,it's taking them all game but back to
145:32,back there are two best pass rushers
145:34,there are two best players on this
145:36,defense coming up big Chris Lauren's
145:40,been a factor too
145:47,this is it pronoia fourth and ten from
145:50,the
145:53,Grady fires
145:55,keep it going in and go up at the
145:56,20-yard line but the clock keeps on
145:59,ticking yeah tremendous the Bradys got
146:04,to get up there block it here 26 seconds
146:09,now and still 78 yards away
146:13,well you desperately need something to
146:16,at least give you a Hail Mary position
146:18,and I'm sure that josh mcdaniels has to
146:22,be thinking what do we have to do to win
146:23,this football game we've been going up
146:25,and down the field but here it is you
146:28,need something around the 50-yard line
146:30,to just have a few shots into the end
146:33,zone
146:39,raylene short bass rock we're just
146:42,trying to get out of bounds and he does
146:44,they got 20 seconds all at the 33 67
146:50,yards away still time to throw something
146:53,over the middle if you had to hustle up
146:56,spike it and still have a shot at the
146:58,end zone
147:04,and that would go down in history let me
147:05,tell you
147:07,[Applause]
147:13,Brady is going to throw short broadcast
147:18,and does boy let's put a little Stefon
147:22,Diggs routine there stayed in bounds
147:25,that took seven seconds off now you got
147:27,13 when he dipped inside who took your
147:31,breath away but here it is and you've
147:34,got one of the great rebounders in
147:37,football history running down the field
147:40,of drum Kowski it's going to get a shot
147:42,at the very least the jump ball but not
147:45,before the Eagles talk about the
147:52,Philadelphia Eagles a guy whose name we
147:54,need to mention here too is Howie
147:55,Roseman the general manager who did a
147:57,phenomenal job free agents trades work
148:04,the salary cap there he is the guy who
148:06,was kind of the odd man out when he lost
148:09,the power struggle with Chip Kelly a
148:11,couple of years ago brought it back in
148:14,phenomenal job building this this team
148:18,absolutely is I kind of thought that we
148:22,might end up seeing one of the receivers
148:24,come in and play dB at the end of
148:27,game in case you got the jump ball but
148:29,nobody in like a 3d bees back to the 20
148:33,rainy floors and it's almost picked off
148:35,that took four seconds that's Darby
148:38,intended for Phillip Dorsett and event
148:43,nine seconds I would rather have two
148:47,shots in the end zone here than that
148:49,nine yards
148:51,[Applause]
148:53,and then you pray for if not a
148:56,completion at least maybe you get a
148:59,defensive pass interference call
149:01,there is nobody anywhere close to as
149:04,tall as Rob Gronkowski with jamming with
149:07,the line
149:08,I would not let him run free
149:12,ready under pressure escapes the sack
149:16,launching one for the end zone there's a
149:19,jump ball and it's a complete that rock
149:22,was the picker
149:25,and time runs out
149:30,and for the Philadelphia Eagles the long
149:34,drought is over finally
149:51,[Applause]
149:56,last championship 1960 pre Super Bowl
150:00,era
150:02,in the Philly fans the dream has finally
150:05,come true
